egyptian officials are investigating a sudden incidence of mass chicken deaths on a chicken farm in the south , fearing that the virus may continue to spread . 
with chicken markets in europe plummeting from the impact of virus incidents , the european commission reiterated that there is actually no reason to panic . 
kyprianou , the european commissioner for health and food safety , said it is understandable that the public is concerned , but there is no need to overreact . 
following an earlier measure creating three - kilometer protection zones and $number - kilometer surveillance zones around outbreaks of the virus , the european commission issued an additional new regulation setting up a " buffer zone " in the entire region of europe where the virus has been discovered . 
an eu official , who declined to be named , said that everyone is on high alert as they process from morning till night news of suspected outbreaks from around europe .

let 's again direct our attention to the iran nuclear issue . 
the international atomic energy agency confirmed on the $number that the iranian government has written a letter to the iaea requesting for the removal of all the equipment monitoring iran 's nuclear facilities by the middle of this month . 
due to the iaea decision to report the iran nuclear issue to the un security council , iran has announced the termination of all its support and cooperation measures on the nuclear issue and will no longer allow the iaea to conduct snap inspection of its nuclear facilities . 
in response to the current tensions concerning the iran nuclear issue , russian foreign minister lavrov said in athens , greece , that the cooperation between russia and iran still exists . 
this will become the motivation for the resolution to the iran nuclear issue . 
a russian foreign ministry spokesperson said that day that russia 's proposal to iran for establishing a joint uranium enrichment enterprise in russia still stands . 
the two sides may conduct negotiations on this issue next week . 
on the same day , lugar , chairman of the us senate foreign relations committee , said at the un headquarters in new york that the us does not endorse israeli attacks on iran 's nuclear facilities . 
some recent news report said that israeli defense experts said that the israeli air force may deal serious blows to iran 's nuclear facilities if necessary . 
according to xinhua news agency , russian deputy foreign minister kislyak said on the $number that russia is willing to cooperate with iran on the nuclear issue so as to help iran obtain the legal right to develop nuclear energy for peaceful purposes . 
kislyak said that russia 's proposal for a joint uranium enrichment enterprise with iran is still valid now . 
russia hopes to have negotiations with iran on this issue in the near future . 
at the end of $date last year , russia submitted a proposal to iran regarding the establishment of a joint uranium enrichment enterprise by the two countries in russia . 
both the eu and the us indicated that they can accept this plan for a compromise . 
however , iran hopes that russia can continue to revise the original plan . 
chinese foreign ministry spokesman kong quan said on the $number that though the iaea reported the iran nuclear issue to the un security council , it did not hand over the agency 's responsibility for handling the iran nuclear issue to the security council . 
therefore , all parties still need to break the deadlock on the iran nuclear issue within the iaea framework . 
according to the iaea resolution , iaea director general elbaradei will submit a report on the iran nuclear issue to the security council in $date . 
the security council will make a final decision after evaluating this report . 
we think this resolution is asking iran to fulfill the relevant security council resolution and its commitments without submitting or referring the issue to the security council . 
recently , china has been seeking a peaceful resolution to the iran nuclear issue through diplomatic channels . 
kong quan said that on $date , zhang yan , director - general of arms control and disarmament department of china 's foreign ministry , and larijani , secretary of iran 's supreme national security council and chief nuclear negotiator , held talks on the iran nuclear issue in tehran . 
the chinese side hopes that iran should pay attention to the key issue of the international community and create conditions for peaceful resolution to the iran nuclear issue . 
solving the iran nuclear issue within the iaea framework not only conforms to the interests of the chinese side but also , as we believe firmly , conforms to the interests of all parties concerned . 
for that purpose , we also call upon all relevant parties in the international community again not to abandon diplomatic efforts for this issue . 
hamas , which is currently forming a new palestinian autonomous government , officially announced that except for the candidate for prime minister , the name list of the new government 's cabinet has been basically finalized .

al - khudairi never mentioned violence or anything against israel in his public speech .

prior to mashal 's reiteration of refusing to recognize israel , marzouk , another hamas political leader , said in an interview with egyptian tv that hamas will absolutely not recognize the legitimate status of israel , but the new government will continue to keep contact with israel in various areas , because recognizing israel or not is a totally different thing from whether to have contact with it .

at $time on the $number , prime minister rasmussen and the foreign minister held a press conference at denmark 's prime minister 's residence . 
rasmussen said . 
the violent incidents occurring at the embassies of several european countries are no longer something between muslim countries and denmark . 
it is very important for the danish government and danish people to get the broad support of the international community to resolve this tough issue . 
we are allied with france . 
some organizations of other european countries and the united states in muslim countries are cooperating closely . 
just a few minutes ago , us president bush made a phone call here . 
in the phone call , he expressed support for denmark , standing by denmark . 
rasmussen said , we also think that we should resolve this issue through dialogue and tolerance , not through violence . 
we stress freedom and democracy , and respect the precious value of religious belief . 
today i appeal to people in all muslim countries to work together to suppress violence and prevent it from spreading . 
we need to resolve the issue through dialogue , not through violence . 
today we are facing growing international developments of the incident .

angry with the publication of the cartoons of muhammad , iranian extremists attacked the danish embassy in tehran again on tuesday , throwing gas bombs . 
in the meantime , a state - owned iranian newspaper , in retaliation , held a contest on cartoons about the nazi holocaust . 
the united states denounced the move as taking the opportunity to reinforce iranian president ahmadinejad 's persistent outrageous anti - israeli practices . 
some $number protesters climbed over the wall and entered the danish embassy compound in iran . 
in addition , $number people threw rocks and gas bombs at the building from outside . 
the day before , student members of iran 's hard - line militia led $number demonstrators in attacking the danish and austrian embassies in tehran . 
the controversial cartoons were $number published by the jutland post in denmark in $date of last year . 
they were successively reprinted in other european countries and three arab newspapers . 
in retaliation , hamshahri , iran 's best - selling newspaper , recently announced that it would hold a contest on cartoons depicting the slaughter of jews by the nazi germany . 
the move was strongly denounced by the united states and other countries . 
us state department spokesman mccormack said that he thinks the move by the best - selling iranian newspaper hamshahri was to reinforce iranian president ahmadinejad 's vicious anti - israeli remarks . 
mccormack reiterated the us support of freedom of speech in all parts of the world , including iran . 
but he thinks hamshahri 's cartoon contest was totally a different thing from the publication of the cartoons of muhammad by the danish media . 
mccormack said , i don 't think that someone will mention iran 's freedom of the press in connection with the freedom of the press in western europe and the united states . 
ahmadinejad once called the holocaust a myth and urged to wipe israel off the map , setting off widespread criticism by the united states and other countries . 
mccormack thinks that hamshahri is funded by the conservative tehran municipal government . 
it was no coincidence that it should hold this cartoon contest .

according to our understanding , under the government 's intentional manipulation , real estate prices in shanghai have become among the highest in the world . 
many government units think of all kinds of ways to forcibly tear down citizens ' residences in high - priced neighborhoods without giving reasonable compensation . 
these ordinary people who have suffered compulsory eviction , thereby losing their homes , have suddenly lost their sources of income . 
children are unable to pay tuition , and cannot attend school . 
for many years , most people who appealed to higher authorities have been sent to reform - through - labor camps for long periods of time . 
according to statistical data , shanghai is the region of china with the largest number of people appealing to higher authorities . 
han zhongming used to own a storefront , yet it was forcibly torn down . his private residence was also sold by others for profit . 
he was put under house arrest by authorities and was even detained because he appealed to higher authorities . 
having jumped from a building and slit his wrists , among other forms of protest , he was only recently released . 
chen enjuan 's storefront was also forcibly torn down by the government . 
the government hired goons to drag her family of three out of their home and used bulldozers to raze the house together with the furniture . 
she was sent to a reform - through - labor camp for nearly two years because she appealed to higher authorities . 
speaking about this hunger strike in support of the protest , chen enjuan said that besides it was for protesting against government iniquity , 
attorney gao has also given us a lot of help and very unselfishly helped us . 
we are safeguarding our rights because we want democracy , ah , because we are thinking of the next generation . 
our older generation has suffered enough . we also need to make sure that the next generation will not suffer persecution . that is why we want to participate in that human rights campaign . we cannot give up . 
according to the center on housing rights and evictions , a geneva - based human rights organization , china has been listed among countries with the most serious housing rights violations in the world . 
this has been an interview report by ntd news correspondent wang xin and guest reporter gu qing 'er . 
in response to the new round of human rights hunger strike campaign initiated by attorney gao zhicheng , many democracy activists and ordinary citizens in hong kong , taiwan , calgary , canada , and the greater philadelphia area in the united states continued to voice their support in various forms on $date . 
the following is a comprehensive report by this station 's correspodnent . 
based on the $number - hour coordinated hunger strike campaign in ten provinces and cities across china on $date initiated by attorney gao zhicheng to protest cpc tyranny , a signature drive has been launched on the streets of hong kong . 
legislator leung kwok - hung , who supports attorney gao zhicheng 's hunger strike campaign , said that cpc authorities recently have made reckless arrests of human rights activists , which is a dangerous signal showing that this government is absolutely not based on popular will .

immediately following the iaea decision to submit the iran nuclear issue to the un security council for resolution , iran reiterated that there is no room for it to have any negotiation with the us , one of the sponsors . 
er , an iranian government spokesperson said on monday that the policy toward the us has so far been not to discuss and negotiate over the relations with the other party . 
he said that the west made a huge mistake to submit the nuclear issue to the security council , which shows the western interference in the development of iran . 
iran said on sunday that it will terminate its cooperation with the iaea . in addition , it will resume uranium enrichment and ban snap inspection of its nuclear facilities . 
well , iran 's attitude is now quite firm on this issue , while the us takes an even firmer attitude . 
er , us defense secretary rumsfeld has frequently reiterated that the use of force will not be ruled out on this issue . 
well , now rumors said that the us military is indeed carrying out such a plan . 
they are researching and developing a super - sized mother of all bombs . 
er , once the defense department issues the order , they will use this super - sized bomb to blow up iran . 
then , how big a bomb is this mother of all bombs ? 
its weight alone is said to be $number pounds , which is equivalent to that of a two - story bus . er , in addition , it is also very large in size . 
well , the main purpose of developing such a super bomb is to blow up some underground facilities in iran . 
since it has an extremely powerful penetration , it can penetrate the concrete as well as steel plate , probably causing a large pit of about $number long and half a mile in size . er , it will destroy many underground construction and facilities . 
well , it now seems that the united states has really started to sharpen its spear or make bombs at the last minute in this respect . 
rumsfeld said that no method will be ruled out on this issue , the resolution to the iran nuclear issue . the method of force has already been put on the agenda . 
in addition , the iran nuclear issue is continuing to escalate . well , er , relevant iranian officials in china said in an interview with this station that actually iran still insists on cooperating with the international community through peaceful negotiations , er , in hopes of relieving the crisis .

earlier russia always expressed its support for iran 's peaceful use of nuclear energy and said it would not refer the iran nuclear issue to the security council . 
however , now we see they have agreed to refer the iran nuclear issue to the un security council . 
under this new situation now , we may make some changes regarding our policy agreed upon with russia earlier . 
yet , before the un security council makes its final decision in $date on whether to adopt economic and political sanctions , iran maintains that it will continue to negotiate with relevant international institutions . at the same time it is willing to cooperate with the international community to relieve the current crisis .

i think the us itself is well aware of this point . 
with regard to the so - called military attacks , we have not seen that the us has declared any explicit position . 
we don 't want to see the crisis further escalate . 
we also emphasize on using the method of peaceful negotiations , but we will not yield to pressure . 
in addition ( ( agebi ) ) also expressed hope that china will continue to cooperate with iran on the basis of its original position .

within its scope , several states in the eastern us were affected . for instance , maryland recorded $number of snow , pennsylvania , $number , and the areas in new york and new jersey , over $number .

well , for new york people , most of their usual sunday activities were also cancelled . oh , few people went outdoors , that is , everyone stayed at home . 
uh - huh . 
what gives people headaches is how they are supposed to go to work on monday . 
in addition , the clear snow , the accumulated snow may cause some flooding . 
so , the governments in these affected areas in the us are studying how to deal with the rushing crowds of commuters and cars on their way to work on monday . 
xiaonan . 
all right . 
thank you , xiaonan , for the latest report from the us . 
since there is no other alternative , we can be relaxed and enjoy this very beautiful snowy scenery . 
let 's look at a few japan - related news items . 
er , koizumi has always wanted to upgrade japan 's defense agency to a ministry , so as to increase japan 's military strength . 
however , along the way , this process has aroused a lot of controversy and undergone many twists and turns . 
recently , some project bid - rigging scandals broke out in the defense facilities administration agency under japan 's defense agency , causing some current and former officials to be arrested by authorities . 
as a result , quite a few people advised koizumi to be careful about upgrading the agency to a ministry . 
well , recently koizumi said that he would shelve this plan and would not submit it to the diet for review for the time being . 
well , he also hopes the two governing parties can carefully discuss this issue and continue , er , consultations . 
on another note , if you go to japan , there is now a new regulation . 
that is , japan plans , stipulates that most tourists and travelers to japan must have their fingerprints scanned and photographs taken . 
this is a way of preventing some dangerous people from entering japanese territory , and in addition , of guarding against illegal immigrants . 
er , so , going to japan should now be even more difficult . 
well , of course , recently there has also been a piece of good news in japan . 
that is , princess kiko , wife of japan 's prince akishinomiya , is pregnant . 
the event makes many japanese hopeful that she can give birth to a boy to succeed the throne . 
however , she also brought some disturbance to the otherwise quite peaceful imperial household . 
er , in fact kiko is now surely quite old for a pregnant woman . moreover , people have always thought she was satisfied with a four - member family . 
to be pregnant again at such an age , many people cannot help speculating that er , this may be a fight for the throne between brothers of the imperial household . 
of course , this conspiracy theory has been a fascinating topic for many people . 
it is said that this matter may be traced back to several years ago . 
er , it is like this . when the wife of crown prince naruhito suffered from depression $date , the imperial household placed little hope on them and turned to put pressure on prince fumihito . 
at that time , fumihito did not respond much to this . 
but $date , the conflict had become somewhat intense , because naruhito , eager to protect his wife , criticized the imperial household in public . 
well , it is said that the imperial household at that time was furious and asked prince fumihito , who is of the same generation , to come out and accuse his elder brother of showing no respect to the imperial household while spoiling his own wife . 
the two brothers have not been on good terms since . 
well , now if a boy is born to prince fumihito , then they , as core members , will become a pillar of the imperial household . 
meanwhile , the eastern palace , that is , the elder prince , would surely decline as a result . 
er , so , quite a number of people think that if this is the case , it will have a great impact on the imperial household and japanese society . 
on monday un secretary general annan went to the white house to meet with us president bush . 
with regard to iran 's announcement of its postponement of nuclear talks with russia , annan urged iran to stop nuclear activities as soon as possible and resolve the issue through negotiations instead of confrontation . 
in addition , some sources said that the us defense department has actually already started planning for an intensive bombing on iran as a last resort should diplomatic efforts fail . 
originally , outsiders think that bush and annan would discuss the possibility of the un security council sanctions against iran , but the two did not publicize any discussion in this regard after their meeting . 
both bush and annan reiterated their hope that the iran nuclear issue should be resolved through negotiations . 
annan expressed his concern that iran started uranium enrichment and decided to postpone nuclear negotiations with russia . 
on the same day , us media reports said that military tactic experts from the pentagon have already started planning for an intensive military action so that the us will prevent iran from developing nuclear weapons by military means should diplomatic efforts fail . 
according to the reports , the commander of the us central command is making decisions on the targets of attacks . 
there may be a submarine - launched ballistic missile strike or air strikes by b-2 bombers . 
on monday , annan called upon all parties involved not to take any action that may escalate the crisis . 
some military experts analyzed that iran may acquire the ability to produce nuclear weapons within two years . 
and there are more than two years left from bush 's $number term . 
he will try to resolve the iran nuclear issue during his term whether by peaceful or military means . 
mo naiqian reporting from washington for phoenix satellite tv . 
iranian president ahmadinejad said on the $number that superpowers that threaten other countries with their own weapons will soon disappear . 
at the $number anniversary of the victory of the islamic revolution , ahmadinejad met with diplomatic envoys of various countries in tehran . 
he said that arms race and competition for hegemony among various countries in the world will achieve nothing . 
the greed of super powers can never be satisfied . they even threaten other countries with their weapons . 
however , he said that these super powers that rely on their weapons to bully other countries will soon disappear . 
the day when mankind enjoys eternal peace and stability will soon come . 
so , we can see this is not merely a battle of words now . in fact , the mounting tensions between iran and the west are indeed becoming more and more intense . 
well , since iran and the us are making no concession to each other in their positions , recently there have also been some format changes . that is , iran officially announced the day before yesterday that they will resume their uranium enrichment programs . 
in fact , some western diplomats speculated that they might have actually resumed some procedures for uranium enrichment prior to this . 
in addition , iran also announced that it would postpone its talks with russia indefinitely . that is , the talks on russia refining uranium for iran . 
well , of course , the indefinite postponement of the talks was also decided based on this new situation . 
well , recently , since the us continues to threaten iran with attacks , the oxford research institute , a uk think tank , issued this report . 
if the us really wants to use force , then half of the people will be dead because of that . in addition , it will of course trigger , um , may keep this year 's wave of violence in the middle east going on . 
besides , some terrorist attacks will also escalate . 
of course , oil prices will also soar , which is also one of the series of domino effects . 
furthermore , this report said that if the us fails to subdue iran , iran will surely speed up its determination to manufacture nuclear weapons on its own . 
well , we just mentioned the issue of the russian - iranian talks . 
an iranian government spokesperson indeed said on monday that due to the new situation , it would postpone its talks with russian officials scheduled for the $number on uranium enrichment in russia . 
however , a russian foreign ministry spokesperson said that no official notification from iran was received yet . 
so , it is still yet too early to tell whether the meeting will be postponed . 
in addition , russia 's federal atomic energy agency director kuchinov said on monday that russia is ready to have talks with iran on the conditions and principle of the negotiations over the nuclear issue . 
at the same time , the us new york times recently published an editorial . 
the title of this editorial is also very conspicuous . it is called japan 's offensive foreign minister . 
well , this editorial specifically mentioned that japanese foreign minister taro aso recently made a string of appalling remarks . 
these remarks were all very dishonest and very unwise . furthermore , the remarks have triggered widespread indignation among asian countries . 
well , this editorial also specifically mentioned that japan should acknowledge its mistakes and learn the lesson rather than avoid mentioning in post - ww ii textbooks some of their deeds during the war as they are doing right now . 
at the same time , the editorial also said that many of taro aso 's current remarks , for instance , requesting the prime minister to visit yasukuni shrine , for instance , saying taiwanese colonial rule raised , um , ah , the japanese colonial rule raised taiwan 's educational level , and so on , it said such remarks were all very appalling . moreover , it is evident that he has no knowledge of history and is a very poor diplomat too . 
since the new york times was $number largest newspaper in circulation in the united states last year , it should be very influential in the us society . 
as a result , such an editorial should also be very influential . 
in the meantime , some former senior us government officials and some us experts on asian issues , they recently held a special forum , that is , a forum on sino - japanese relations . 
well , at this forum , some experts put forward this viewpoint . 
it said that as current sino - japanese relations are under great tensions , there may be potential danger of military conflict . 
furthermore , it even said that now there is a greater possibility of a military conflict breaking out between china and japan than between china and taiwan . 
er , moreover , once the military conflict breaks out , it will surely drag the us into it because the us will surely get involved . 
well , a japanese foreign ministry spokesperson also participating in the forum said that sino - japanese relations are now indeed under great tensions . 
so , any mistake will lead to serious consequences . 
on another note , the georgian parliament 's defense and security committee held an expanded meeting and decided to expel the russian peacekeeping force from south ossetia . 
the russian parliament will hold a general assembly to review this bill today . 
er , experts think that if the parliament agrees to expel the russian peacekeeping force , it may lead to the complete breakup of georgian - russian ties . 
a spokesperson for the russian peacekeeping force said on the $number that two of the russian peacekeeping contingent 's military vehicles transporting foods were intercepted by georgian police with the driver expelled . 
er , the spokesperson called for georgia to stop immediately such provocations ; otherwise russia would assume no responsibility for the consequences of the incident . 
two military vehicles belonging to the logistic system of the russian peacekeeping contingent transporting foods and groceries were examined by georgian police monday night in georgia 's south ossetia . 
georgian law enforcement personnel on duty expelled the russian driver and escorting personnel and forcibly drove away the two military vehicles . 
the incident greatly angered the russian peacekeeping force . 
a spokesperson for the russian peacekeeping force said that on $date , georgian police detained a russian military vehicle in the area on an excuse of a traffic accident and has not returned it so far . 
on $date , three russian military officers were detained for two days and nights on grounds of visa problems . 
georgia 's reckless provocations were aimed to incur bloodshed in the area by forcing the russian troops to open fire so that it could achieve the goal of the withdrawal of the peacekeeping force from south ossetia . 
on that day , the russian embassy in georgia made serious representations to the georgian side , demanding georgia to immediately stop frenzied provocations ; otherwise the russian side will not assume any consequence of the resulting conflict . 
the media noted that on $date , georgian defense minister okruashvili announced that the head of the russian military base in akhalkalaki sold several strela portable air defense missile systems to south ossetia . 
on that day , the georgian parliament defense and security committee held an expanded meeting to hear a report by the law enforcement agency . it decided to expel the russian peacekeeping troops in georgia and called for a review of this issue at the general assembly on the $number . 
experts think that the final decision , once passed , may eventually lead to the complete breakup of georgian - russian ties . 
earlier , georgian foreign minister bezhuashvili vehemently criticized the russian position and refuted russian president putin 's remark that russia may recognize abkhazia and south ossetia should the west recognize kosovo . he thinks that russian authorities are sending an encouraging signal to all secessionist districts . 
the russian foreign ministry also announced earlier that it would protect russian citizens in south ossetia , implying a direct threat of military force to georgia .

since the us military also expressed hope for more transparency in china 's pla operations while inviting china to participate in the military exercise , some defense experts think that this shows the pentagon 's hope to sound each other out through the joint military exercise because it is not sure about the purpose of china 's military expansion . 
in addition , since the defense review report released by the pentagon at the beginning of this month considered china the greatest potential threat , the two defense experts also pointed out that the asia - pacific military exercise is $number step that the us department of defense takes to adjust its strategy on this basis .

host . 
eh , all right . 
er , besides , it is actually not $number time that chinese engineering personnel were killed in attacks in pakistan . 
such an incident occurred in $date . 
two chinese engineers were kidnapped by an armed group in south waziristan . 
in the end , one of them unfortunately died during the rescue mission .

consequently , chinese people have fallen victims several times to attacks and abductions .

let 's look at a few japan - related news items . 
recently there has been a rather shocking piece of news in japanese political circles . 
that is , tsuneo watanabe , chairman of the yomiuri shimbun , the number one in the japanese media , he ordered the yomiuri shimbun to publish some articles against koizumi 's visit to yasukuni shrine . furthermore , the yomiuri shimbun has since taken a position against koizumi 's visit to yasukuni shrine . 
er , well , um , tsuneo watanabe , he was lashing out against koizumi in his speech a few days ago , saying he is very ignorant and has no knowledge of any history or culture . 
at the same time he also said that visiting yasukuni shrine is like singing praises of hitler . in addition , he said that by doing so , koizumi also made china and south korea consider japan a very dangerous country . this is going to have no end of trouble . 
well , why could tsuneo watanabe , his attitude trigger great impact ? 
actually , he is also very influential in political circles and has been a manipulator behind the scenes all along . 
yet , he used to be a very rightist figure . 
we should say he had always supported hawks and also pushed vigorously for constitutional amendment . 
but now , ah , this is really a big turn . 
he now directed his attacks against koizumi and started to oppose such a stance . 
actually $date when someone attacked koizumi for visiting yasukuni shrine , um , tsuneo watanabe , he still said , he said , er , he supported him and wanted koizumi to resist the pressure . 
however , he gave a speech recently . he said , i am already $number years old and don 't have much time left . 
well , he has now adopted a high - sounding tone and taken on a kind of highly anti - war stance in his speech . 
this kind of changing sides by him , of course , has a great social impact in japan . 
just like tsuneo watanabe said himself , he said , i firmly believe i have the actual power of controlling and changing the political orientation . 
furthermore , he also said that should the yomiuri shimbun 's freedom of speech and freedom of coverage and compilation be under the government pressure , he would resist it at the risk of his life . 
well , what kind of situation has it come to now ? 
that is , the yomiuri shimbun , the largest newspaper in japan , and the asahi shimbun , $number largest newspaper in japan , now these two large newspapers have started to join hands in opposing koizumi 's visit to yasukuni shrine . 
originally , these two large newspapers were opponents , but later when the two chairmen met , they at least reached consensus on this issue . 
as a result , they now both launched massive attacks on koizumi , forming what we could call a dream team . 
actually , these two large newspapers of theirs should have a very large influence on japanese mainstream public opinion . 
in addition , let 's look at the meeting of japan 's house of representatives . at one of their recent meetings , two relatively popular candidates for successor to japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi made the same remark . 
who are these two people ? 
one is chief cabinet secretary shinzo abe , and the other is japanese foreign minister taro aso , who has made a series of appalling remarks recently . 
what remarks did these two make ? 
they said that japan 's wwii criminals were not criminals . 
what they meant was , er , it was the international court that has called them criminals and convicted them . 
whereas , in japan , according to the international law , they were ; according to the domestic law in japan , er , the war criminals did not violate the domestic law of japan . 
therefore , they think that wwii criminals should not be considered criminals in japan . 
at the same time , um , shinzo abe , he also mentioned that japan should now focus its vision on the whole world and develop relations with the united states and develop commercial and trade relations with , um , some east asian countries . in addition , it should also try its best to develop close ties with india . it should not always focus on china .

chinese experts : us playing up " china military threat " is groundless accusation 
xinhua news agency , beijing , $date ( correspondents li xuanliang , xiong zhengyan , and lin liping ) in the quadrennial defense review that the us pentagon has officially submitted to congress recently , china was for $number time called " an emerging power that has the greatest potential to militarily challenge the united states . " 
experts think this is a groundless accusation against china 's normal national defense construction . it plays up " china military threat " and interferes in china 's internal affairs . 
the quadrennial defense review is the pentagon 's new national defense guideline document . 
the $number - page - long report devoted three paragraphs to commenting on china 's military issues and the countermeasures the united states should take . directly mentioning the two phrases of " china " or " chinese " $number times , the report said that " as a major and emerging power , china has the greatest potential to compete militarily with the united states . if the united states does not have countermeasures , china will very likely develop disruptive military technologies so as to destroy us a 
yao yunzhu , a research fellow from the department of world military studies of the chinese military academy of sciences , said that though senior us officials expressed similar views on various occasions earlier , this is $number time the united states proposed in its " national defense strategy report " that " china is an emerging power that has the greatest potential to militarily challenge the united states . " 
" the report for $number time explicitly refers to russia , india and china as emerging strategic rivals ; in particular , more attention was given to the so - called ' china military threat , ' "

noticeably , on the same day the quadrennial defense review was officially submitted , us president bush also submitted a government budget for the $number fiscal year to congress , with the national defense budget at $number us dollars . 
" if the additional budget for military operations in iraq and afghanistan is added , the us national defense budget for $number fiscal year will go beyond the milestone of $number dollars , an all time high , " peng guangqian said . " that is almost equal to the sum of the military spending of all the other countries in the world . " 
peng guanqian thinks that the fabrication of " foreign threats " by the united states reflected the pentagon 's habitual style of " making enemies " and that its real purpose is to secure more national defense funds so that the huge us arms industry groups can fish for more profits . 
experts said that compared with huge military expenditures of the united states , china 's national defense expenditures are quite limited . 
deng hongzhou , a military expert who has participated several times in drafting the white papers on china 's national defense , said that china 's defense expenditures have somewhat increased with economic development since $date , but the proportion it takes in the state national budget for the same period is on the decline . 
official statistics show that compared with $number , the proportion of china 's expenditures for national defense $date in the state budget for the same period dropped by nearly $number percentage points . 
$date china 's expenditures for national defense was $number rmb , only $number of that of the united states . its military expenditure per capita was $number of that of the united states , and its military funding per soldier was $number of that of a us soldier . 
" the united states is equal to china in terms of territorial area , but there is such a big difference in military expenditures . it is self - evident whose military power is beyond normal defense needs . " 
peng guangqian said . 
teng jianqun , director of the research department of the china arms control and disarmament association , said that the united states should evaluate china 's military construction situation objectively and that china 's peaceful development doesn 't necessarily mean that china and the united states will become military antagonists in the future . 
china 's $number white paper on national defense says that china firmly adheres to the path of peaceful development and adopts a national defense policy that is defensive in nature . 
china has never threatened any country in the past and at present , and will never do so in the future . 
so far china has not set up any military base in any other country , nor has china dispatched a single soldier to other countries . in contrast , the united states has established $number military bases overseas and has deployed $number soldiers in asia alone . 
zhu feng , a professor of the international relations institute of peking university , said that china and the united states should increase communication and exchange through established channels and enhance understanding and mutual trust so as to fully push forward the china - us constructive cooperation in the new century and jointly promote and safeguard world peace and development .

what new policies hamas will push for will directly impact the direction of subsequent corresponding policies by the various parties to the peace process . 
in the meantime , resistance by the us and israel will add to the uncertainty about the prospects of the hamas government . 
at present , various parties in palestine are accelerating consultations and actively seeking breakthroughs on difficulties and sensitive points regarding future developments involved in forming the cabinet . 
( subtitle ) who will become prime minister ? 
after hamas obtained the right to form the cabinet , some outsiders worried that disagreements could occur between " prime minister hamas " and current top leader abbas . 
in addition , hamas leader mashal , who is currently visiting egypt , stressed that the new palestinian government led and formed by hamas will not recognize israel . this strong message also increased international concern . 
the us and israel explicitly said that they would not accept a hamas government which possesses actual power , threatening to discontinue economic aid and tax transfers to palestine . 
however , this did not hinder hamas from making a flexible tactical adjustment , selecting an independent individual as a compromise . 
according to reports , in order to obtain maximum international recognition , hamas leaders both at home and abroad , who recently gathered in egypt , decided to select independent jamal al - khudairi , board chairman of the islamic university in gaza , as new prime minister . 
the move has yet to receive responses from relevant parties . 
palestinian analyst hussein said that no matter who becomes prime minister , the key is that the prime minister nominee should try to downplay the hard - line stance of hamas . only in this way can success in forming a cabinet be ensured . 
( subtitle ) how to divide power ? 
internally , the biggest challenge hamas faces in forming a cabinet is its lack of sufficient experience in governance . 
an article carried in the palestinian newspaper al - ayyam analyzed that although hamas won popularity through its social welfare programs , it lacks experience in governance . it would be wise for it to cooperate with the palestinian national liberation movement ( fatah ) , which has experience in governance . 
following the elections , hamas proposed establishing a " political partnership " with fatah so as to jointly form a national coalition government . however , fatah has not responded enthusiastically so far . 
fatah is currently divided internally with regards to joining the cabinet . one faction advocates joining the new government so as to make some kind of move , while another faction rejects the hamas invitation , preferring to be an " active opposition " in the legislative council . 
sources noted that under abbas 's persuasion , fatah is gradually leaning toward joining the new government . 
in spite of this , hamas and fatah will still bargain over the distribution of cabinet positions . 
in addition , another approach is to form a cabinet outside the framework of the legislative council , breaking away from partisan affiliations . 
according to reports , hamas has designed a government exclusively composed of experts , but the specific name list is unknown . 
based on us and israeli attitudes , forming a government composed of technical experts would also be a good way to relieve outside pressure . 
according to the provisions of the palestinian basic law , after the new legislative council assumes power on the $number of this month , the nomination of the prime minister and formation of the cabinet will be completed within three to five weeks . 
( subtitle ) what about arms ? 
the weapons it possesses is another tough issue hamas faces in forming the new government . 
the us and israel are very firm in their positions , resolutely demanding that hamas abandon violence and rejecting its armed participation in the government . 
hamas leader mashal stressed on the $number that armed resistance is a " strategic choice " of the organization . 
the issue of weapons actually exists on two levels , the legitimacy of arms and the affiliation and administration of armed forces . 
hamas won international recognition by being elected the top major party in the legislative council through democratic and free methods . the way to similarly legalize its subordinate armed faction az a - din al - qassam brigades is to integrate it into government security institutions . 
hamas had previously proposed unifying armed forces of all factions into a " people 's army " of the palestinian national authority , yet failed to get widespread response and was criticized by the palestinian islamic jihad ( jihad ) . 
at present , palestine has $number security agency personnel , most of whom come from the fatah camp . 
in addition , fatah has some loosely organized subordinate armed factions , such as al - aqsa martyrs ' brigades and the fatah hawks . 
hamas , which is responsible for forming the cabinet , must reach a consensus with abbas as to how to manage these autonomous armed forces and reasonably divide administrative power . 
according to local media reports , abbas intends to be in charge of security and intelligence forces , while leaving agencies such as the police and civil defense under the administration of the interior ministry of the new government . 
however , the various parties are still negotiating over this sensitive issue , with no outcome so far .

japanese researchers develop new type of high - efficiency artificial kidney 
xinhua news agency , tokyo , $date ( correspondent qian zheng ) researchers at japan 's tokai university have developed a type of bio - artificial kidney , which not only has the same catabolic functions as a human kidney , but also the function of preserving useful substances . in addition it is small in size and easy to transplant . with further research , there is hope it will bring good news to kidney patients . 
according to a recent nikkei business daily report , the newly - developed bio - artificial kidney mainly consists of two parts , an artificial nephron that filters metabolic waste and water from the blood and an artificial renal tubule that returns to the blood the useful ingredients in primary urine , such as water and amino acids . 
both the " artificial nephron " and the " artificial renal tubule " are made of hollow fibers . in addition , the interior of the artificial renal tubule is fully lined with renal tubular epithelial cells which have the ability to decompose metabolic waste . 
the epithelial cells can decompose the causative substance of dialysis - related amyloidosis , a disease caused by repeated hemodialysis , into amino acids and return them to the blood while reabsorbing into the blood the glucose , vitamins , and minerals the body needs . 
in contrast , previous artificial kidneys , depending on the difference of osmotic pressures to filter metabolic waste , were unable to remove that completely and nor did they have the ability to return ingredients such as amino acids to the blood . 
researchers tested the bio - artificial kidney transplant on goats , using a pig 's epithelial cells to line the interior of the hollow fibers of the artificial kidney . 
two weeks later , researchers confirmed that the artificial kidney had been able to function . 
they are presently developing a bio - artificial kidney using human renal cells and will start clinical studies after testing its safety .

( winter olympics - stimulants ) news analysis : pyleva case likely to end where it is 
xinhua news agency , turin , $date news analysis : pyleva case likely to end where it is 
xinhua correspondents gao peng and ding ying 
although italy has said repeatedly that all athletes found using stimulants during the turin winter olympics may face " prison sentences , " based on various circumstances at this time , such fate is unlikely to happen to russian biathlete olga pyleva , the center of $number stimulant scandal at this winter olympics . 
on the $number , $number stimulant scandal broke out at the turin winter olympics when olga pyleva was found to have used carphedon , a banned drug . 
the next day the international olympic committee announced that pyleva had been expelled from the winter olympics . in addition , she was stripped of the individual biathlon silver medal for women 's $number km event she won at this winter olympics . 
on the same day , the international biathlon union decided to give pyleva a two - year ban from the competition . 
it has always been the ioc regulation that athletes found using stimulants at the olympic games be subject to revocation of their achievements and the eligibility to compete , but they are not subject to legal sanctions . 
however , under italian law , athletes ' carrying and using stimulants are considered criminal acts . prosecution agencies have the right to directly arrest and investigate athletes on stimulants , and violators also face a prison sentence of between three months and three years . 
in $date last year , after " bargaining " for a year , the ioc and the italian government finally reached an agreement , under which the two sides will deal with cases of athletes using stimulants at this winter olympics in accordance with the italian law . 
through the untiring efforts of the ioc , the italian side made concession four days before the winter olympics opened , promising that police would not enter the olympic village to raid athletes ' quarters during the winter olympics , but athletes tested positive for drugs are still subject to investigations of italian prosecutors . 
some reports said that pescante , an italian government official supervising the turin winter olympics , has already turned over the case of pyleva using stimulant to turin 's prosecutors . 
however , the ioc and pescante himself so far have not confirmed it yet . 
russian biathlon team doctor andrey dmytriev disclosed at noon on the $number that pyleva has already left turin for her country . 
shi kangcheng , a chinese sports official who formerly worked at the world anti - doping agency for many years , thinks that once pyleva returns to her country , this incident may eventually " end where it is . " 
shi kangcheng said that the ioc and the italian government have never " thoroughly resolved " the anti - stimulant issue at the winter olympics . even if the italian prosecution agency really gets involved in this case , the outcome is still hard to tell . 
based on italy 's penalties on its own athletes in the previous cases of stimulant abuse , the maximum penalties violators got were only " two - year deferred imprisonment . " 
therefore , piaili , a senior reporter from the italian news agency ansa , said that there is " little " chance that pyleva will go to jail . she would just face fines at maximum . 
piaili also said that although the italian court can hold a trial in absentia , the italian police will not be able to go abroad to catch pyleva and bring her back for serving the sentence . 
if pyleva refuses to accept the judgment , the italian side will not be able to do anything to her .

eleven villages urgently evacuated in philippines to prepare against another landslide 
xinhua news agency , manila , $date philippine local officials said on the $number that eleven villages in the eastern philippines were urgently evacuated to prepare against another similar landslide . 
rosette lerias , a southern leyte official , said this day that these villages are located in the same area as the village where the landslide occurred on the $number and have similar features . 
residents evacuated from the eleven villages will be placed in seven evacuation centers . 
lerias said : " the government ordered residents to evacuate yesterday and sent people to check these villages today because some people were reluctant to leave their homes . " 
the landslide on the $number occurred in a hillside village in the town of saint bernard in southern leyte province . the tv image showed that mud and rocks have buried the entire village with only a few rooftops visible . 
since the mud was extremely thick and wet , the chance of survival for those buried underneath was very slim . 
so far $number people have been found dead while another $number people were rescued . 
it was estimated that the death toll from this disaster may reach $number . 
( life in hometowns of overseas chinese ) $number month this year sees year - on - year growth of $number in exports in southern fujian city of quanzhou , hometown of overseas chinese 
xinhua news agency , fuzhou , $date ( guo yu ) in $date this year , foreign trade exports in quanzhou city continued to maintain its momentum of fast growth . 
according to the customs statistics , in $date exports in quanzhou had the best performance in history and increased by $number year - on - year , higher than the average growth rate in the province , to $number us dollars . 
according to the analysis by the quanzhou municipal foreign economic relations and trade bureau , the city 's fast growth in foreign trade in $date was attributed to the effects of several foreign trade support services measures in quanzhou , which have highly motivated companies for exports , vitalized economic operations in quanzhou , increased business confidence of companies , and provided an efficient and smooth environment for foreign trade development . 
championship hopeful but not assured 
love life , love luneng 
the fire will soon be lit on the battlefield of the chinese super league . 
luneng taishan is getting ready for the new season and preparing to fight again for the championship . 
the fight for the championship among dalian , shandong , and shanghai is on the verge of breaking out . 
who will win the championship in the end ? 
based on an analysis of strength , although the taishan team has great hopes of winning the championship , it is not $number percent assured . 
$number , new team members have little time to get adjusted . 
the taishan team had four major openings last year . 
this year , following recruitment of the two famous national football players li leilei and wang liang , the taishan team will soon be joined by two foreign players . its strength should be said to have increased without decreasing . 
however , since the national team is preparing for matches with palestine and iraq , there has hardly been any coordination between the national team players and their teammates . 
by the time they return to the team , the super league will be starting . 
therefore , the problem of getting adjusted is the biggest problem the taishan team now faces . 
in my opinion , the national football players can serve as substitutes in $number few super league matches . 
$number , the games can be used as practice to get the team adjusted . 
$number , it can allow the players who have just finished two group matches with the national team to take a rest . 
after sharpening their skills in several matches , it will not be too late to enter the battle . 
the next problem is the hidden troubles on defense . 
last year , the taishan team 's defense was criticized by football fans . 
this year , defense has been improved somewhat with the recruitment of li leilei , but it 's not yet time to rest easy . 
the central back still has a problem with turning around slowly , while the substitute players are either slightly old or lack sufficient experience . 
if the central back can put forth a stable performance this year , then the taishan team will have a greater chance of winning the championship . 
i think it may be a good idea to use ren yongshun , who is in good physical shape . despite insufficient experience , he can test himself this year and prepare for the future . 
in addition , it is also fine to recall gao yao to play sweeper . 
there are quite a few members of the taishan team who can play defensive midfield . both cui peng and haibin can play . 
gao yao , who is physically strong and fierce in intercepting the ball , should be able to do a good job as central back . 
also , whether the foreign players can adjust themselves ... 
issues with foreign players have constantly been a big problem for the taishan team . 
last year , danciulescu 's performance left much to be desired . 
i know the foreign players for this year have not been determined yet . 
i think that this year , in addition to recruiting an excellent striker , a pure left midfielder should be recruited . 
except for xing rui a few years ago , the taishan team has not had a single true left - footed specialist . 
although cui peng and others are all competent , however , a real left midfielder is still much better than a stand - in . 
if these three problems can be resolved well , the road to the championship for the taishan team should be a bit smoother . 
as a shandong football fan , i hope very much that the taishan team will win the championship this year . 
however , to be honest , based on this year 's competitive situation , the taishan team has great hopes but there are few assurances . 
batey ads merges with jwt network , would it be too late to say happy new year ? 
brandvista post : 
hello , everyone . 
once again spring festival is behind us . our friends who combined their vacation days with spring festival holidays are returning to their work . 
wish all friends a happy new year , if it is still not too late to say happy new year . 
when i was chatting with nplcn in a cafe the other day , he mentioned the current brandvista . 
the website has become much prettier . 
the layout of the content is pretty good . 
what he likes most is still the recent fully revamped discuz - based community bbs . 
speaking of the community , i will have to thank one person . 
that is mr. li mingshun , general manager of discuz beijing company . 
if you search for his name on google , you can get a lot of hits . 
i roughly know that he used to be at sina and later started his own business , an internet ad exchange platform for small and medium - sized businesses , similar to adbrite.com abroad . 
at that time he debated on msn to the effect that vista thinks that the development of many sectors in china all depends on private economy and growth of small and medium - sized businesses . 
however , the situation in this respect in china 's markets now is not encouraging . 
therefore , the creative media sector and the similar consulting sector serving small and medium - sized businesses are unable to grow into large scale . 
charging higher fees to facilitate its own development eventually led to an unfulfilling cycle . 
later he came to discuz . 
discuz is an excellent community software based on php and mysql database . 
with the help of ramboo , a technical engineer in beijing , the brandvista community finally saw hope again and emerged with a brand - new look . 
the feedback is excellent . 
the interface is clean - cut and friendly . 
the speed is quite fast . 
writing some texts inspirational both to myself and to others on a freshly clean - cut interface and exchanging details in my work and life with friends of the same aspiration working in the same industry , i started to think this is a kind of happiness . 
thanks , discuz ! 
there has been quite a lot of news lately in the advertising sector . 
starting from $date , the wto regulations on the liberalization of advertising went into effect . 
large foreign companies have been arriving at the scene , while smaller foreign companies are getting ready . prosperity seems to be everywhere . 
batey advertising , which originated in singapore , has encountered quite a lot of trouble . 
after losing several heavyweight clients in a row and suffering a series of setbacks in its development in mainland china , sir martin finally found some time away from the lawsuit in italy to think about reshuffling his cards . 
batey advertising , batey will merge with the jwt network while keeping its brand name under the jwt management . 
in the meantime , there is rumor that bates and the $number network will soon merge with ogilvyone and will be managed by the ogilvyone ad network . 
though $number earlier reported it to ogilvyone , it would be interesting for bates asia to report it to ogilvyone . 
during the spring festival several articles have been updated on the website . i will not go into details here . 
you may go check them out on the website if you have time . 
at the same time , those friends who have not entered the new forum may as well make an extra click to access the brand - new community at brandvista 
to experience the environment and atmosphere as well as to contribute some texts . 
hope you will feel the happiness of finding where you belong . 
wish all friends a beautiful state of mind . 
best wishes !

mom ten years ago 
helen li 
i saw this article and want to share it with you . 
this is not out of a momentary impulse but of warmth and kindness cherished long at heart . 
i asked myself how i would act if it were me . 
the answer was very clear . i would put down the phone with a " you dialed a wrong number . " 
i have been thinking this year what exactly can be considered helping others . 
i have already given up those momentary actions such as making monetary or material donations . 
two days ago , a friend said , i have already no time to take care of myself . even if i want to help others , i will not have the energy to do it . 
wish you a pleasant day : )

mom ten years ago 
on that day ten years ago , when this teacher was taking a nap at home during noontime break , the telephone rang suddenly . 
she picked up the phone and listened , yet out came a strange rough voice : " we have caught your kid stealing a book . come here quick ! " 
coming from the other end of the line was a little girl 's crying , along with loud scolding voices of others . 
glancing over at her only daughter , who was watching tv nearby , it suddenly dawned upon her . 
obviously , a little girl must have got caught by the sales person while she was stealing a book . as she did not want to let her family know it , she must have made up a phone number at random . that was how they happened to call here . 
of course she could put down the phone and ignored the call . she could also even reprimand the other party , 
because this incident had nothing to do with her . 
however , being a teacher , she thought she might be her own student . 
the phone call gave her some rough idea that the little girl , who made the momentary slip , must be very much frightened and was facing perhaps the most horrifying situation in her life . 
hesitating for a moment , an idea suddenly occurred to her . right , just do it this way . 
so , after making sure about the bookstore 's address , she hurried there . 
just as she expected , a tearful little girl was standing in the bookstore , 
while adults nearby were yelling at her in fierce reproof . 
she rushed up to hold the poor little girl in her arms . turning around , she said to the sales person nearby : " talk to me . don 't scare the kid . " 
amid the sales person 's reluctant mutterings , she paid the fine of about a few dozen yuan before she was able to lead this little girl out of the bookstore and take a close look at that tear - smudged , terrified face . 
she laughed and took the little girl home . she gave her a good cleaning and let the girl go without asking anything . 
before she took off , she made a special effort to tell her repeatedly , if you want to read books , just come to the auntie 's place . there are many books inside . 
the little girl , who had still not yet recovered from her horror , took a close look at her and scampered away . she never reappeared . 
time went by like a rushing stream . ten years had passed in a flash before she knew it . 
having long forgotten this thing , she still lived here , leading a quiet and peaceful life . 
one day at noon , there was a series of knocks on the door . 
when she opened the door , she saw a stranger , a pretty young girl with all smiles on her face and her hands full of gifts . 
" who are you looking for ? " 
she asked doubtfully . 
in her excitement , that girl said a great deal . 
only with great efforts in following the narration of that girl , a stranger to her , did she suddenly realize that she was that little girl of that year . she had graduated smoothly from college after ten years and now took this trip purposely to visit her . 
with her eyes glistening with tears , the young girl said softly : " though i have never understood even today why you were willing to pretend to be my mom to help me out , i have always felt all these ten years that i want to call you mom . " 
the teacher 's eyes also grew blurry . 
she asked curiously : " if i had not helped you , what would have happened ? " 
the girl 's face immediately darkened . she gently shook her head and said : " i am not sure . i could have done something foolish and might have even committed suicide . " 
the teacher 's heart trembled , and she started to feel rejoiced secretly . 
the decision she made on the spur of the moment that year turned out to have had such an impact on one person 's life . 
looking at the happy smile on the girl 's face , she also smiled .

when this world is filled with lies and fraud like junk text messages everywhere , buddha said , if i don 't go to hell , who else goes to hell . 
if anyone has done this , then congratulations , because he could become buddha earlier . 
human beings at their birth are naturally good . 
compassion lies in the heart of every human being . 
the moral degeneration of the world is getting worse day by day . people are not what they were in times past . 
perhaps only self - sacrificing buddha can do some good deeds . 
observation on military situation : how long would iran be able to hold on against us military air strikes ? 
yun feiquan 
if we liken a traditional war of attrition to making the enemy bleed to death , then modern warfare is firing a bullet right into the enemy 's head at the outset , turning it into a " vegetable " with no time to bleed . 
the difference between iran and the us in military power is not in the numbers but in their understanding of modern warfare . 
iran , which fought an eight - year war with iraq without any distinguishable winner , does not seem to understand the real significance of modern high - tech warfare . 
the british international intelligence review recently mentioned , after analyzing us military deployments , that us troops are preparing to launch a large - scale air strike on iran ... 
the current status of the iranian air force is rather worrisome . 
the current status of the iranian air force is very similar to the pre - war iraqi air force $date . 
the home country does not have the ability to develop modern weapons independently and is also under the arms embargo imposed by the west . 
upon the breakout of war , it is quite uncertain whether the old and outdated planes of the iranian air force could take off and fight the us military . 
currently , iran 's air defense system is chiefly composed of the air force and land - based air defense force of iran 's regular military as well as the air defense force of the revolutionary guard corps . 
among these , the iranian air force is currently $number strong and has $number fighter planes of various models . 
the main plane models are us - made f-4 phantoms , f-5 tigers , and f-14 tomcats , and russian - made mig-29s , among others . 
the land - based air defense forces are mainly equipped with us - made hawk , british - made arrow , and some russian - made sam series surface - to - air missiles . 
analyzing the current status of the iranian air defense forces , harold hutchinson , a us military expert , khramchikhin , a military expert at russia 's institute of political and military analysis , and others think that looking at the current situation , there are still some holes in iran 's air defense capabilities and its air defense system construction . 
hutchinson thinks that in terms of overall real power , the iranian air force is absolutely not at the same level as the us military . 
the large number of us - made fighter planes iran has are inoperable due to lack of spare parts , upgrades , and maintenance . 
of the f-14 fighters , once considered the trump of the iranian air force , currently only $number - plus can take off . 
it is also questionable whether the aim-54 phoenix missiles that they carry , which are said to have over - the - horizon attack capability , are reliable in actual battle . 
khramchikhin mentioned that the air defense missile systems that the us provided to iran $date and $date have lost combat power due to lack of spare parts . 
some other non - system air defense weapons acquired from russia and other countries are no match for the us military , which is capable of electromagnetic countermeasures . 
scraping it together has an effect on combat power . 
the iranian government obviously also realizes that its fate in war depends on its ability to defend the home skies . in a last - minute effort to update its weaponry , it scraped together all it could get to reinforce its air defense system . 
from what can be seen at present , its methods can be summarized into two . 
$number , work hard to conceal key nuclear facilities to enhance its capability to defend against attacks . 
according to a report by the british newspaper the times , iran has concealed the core parts of nuclear facilities such as the natanz nuclear plant and isfahan uranium enrichment center as deep as $number meters underground and encased them with $number - meter thick cement protection . 
however , the us military is a step ahead , having seen the effects of underground bunkers during the $number gulf war in defending against air strikes , it rushed development of various kinds of ground penetrating bombs . 
after more than ten years of targeted research , the us military now has a complete package of combat methodology and weapons to deal with reinforced underground bunkers . 
iran has recently also bought large quantities of air defense weaponry from russia . 
since the end of last year , the iranian government has made successive agreements with russia to purchase the pechora-2a air defense missile system , along with $number sets of the tor - m1 air defense missile system worth $number us dollars . 
however , modern warfare is a competition between systems . 
the various air strike weapons of the us military were all developed independently by their own country . furthermore , after years of real war experience , they have been adapted into a set of impressive and effective war machines . 
in contrast , whether the " new weapons " iran gathered from other countries and put together can become a combat force within such short period of time is still an issue . 
iran is not lagging behind in weapons only . 
the army field manual published by the us military $date proposed for $number time the doctrine of " air land battle , " which emphasizes attacking the enemy 's deeply strategic and high - value targets using air superiority to paralyze the enemy 's command system at the start of the war so that the enemy can become nothing more than " meat on the chopping board " no matter how powerful its regular military strength . 
in the $number gulf war , the $number kosovo war , and the $number iraq war , the us military cared not about how many planes the enemy had but the range of its own tomahawk cruise missiles . 
although the iranian government has been preparing for possible air strikes and has started taking measures to enhance its air defense capabilities , iran , which fought an eight - year war with iraq without any distinguishable winner , does not seem to understand the real significance of modern high - tech warfare . 
along with the us military 's progress in recent years in military transformation work , the us military 's air strike operations already completely differ from vietnam war era carpet bombing , depending instead on various kinds of high - tech weapons and on modern information technology - based high precision and full depth air attacks . 
confronted with such air strikes , it is still unknown how long iran 's land - based air defense system would be able to hold on .

joining hands with google in battling microsoft , dell charges software vendors " shelving fees ? " 
yun feiquan 
dell inc . ( us : dell ) and google confirmed on tuesday that dell is testing personal computers that have installed google pack . 
this move may pose a severe threat against microsoft 's (msft) dominant position in the pc software market . 
dell press spokesman jess blackburn indicated that the company is evaluating google 's software . 
after installing this software , pc users can use the software to search the web as well as search for information stored on the pc . 
blackburn confirmed that at this time , the software being tested by the company include a google - supported dell homepage , google desktop search , and google toolbar . 
at the same time , google press spokesman jon murchinson also confirmed that his company and dell were testing a bundle of software developed by google . 
earlier , the wall street journal reported that it upstart google was in the process of negotiations with dell and hewlett - packard co . , among others , in hopes of convincing these computer manufacturing giants to include google software in their pcs . 
according to insider sources quoted by the wall street journal , google may pay up to $number us dollars to dell over the next three years to achieve this goal . 
however , the two companies did not reveal any of the relevant details . 
in addition , hewlett packard refused to comment . 
microsoft press spokesman neil charney refused to comment on the above news . 
as of now , microsoft is planning to release its next - generation windows operating system search tool and boost its development of web services . 
on the day the news was released , google 's stock price again dropped by $number us dollars . 
microsoft 's stock price fell this day by $number , closing at $number us dollars . 
some analysts pointed out that google is urgently seeking directions for growth outside of web search . joining hands with pc giants such as dell may cause google to threaten microsoft 's core business . 
matt rosoff , an analyst from market research firm directions on microsoft , indicated that google is in a rush to expand its revenue sources , which is definitely something microsoft is concerned about . 
however , some analysts are rather unimpressed . 
charles di bona , an analyst from market analysis firm sanford c. bernstein , pointed out that it is still too early for google to shake microsoft windows ' dominant position . 
reporter 's note : google shaking microsoft 's throne ? 
huizhengyi 
computers have doubtlessly become a necessity for modern people in their life and work . 
however , while everybody uses a computer skillfully , only a handful of people actually know the operating principle of a computer . 
just as using a " foolproof " camera , as long as the interface is friendly and software is easy to use , most beginners can equally feel comfortable operating such a black box as a computer . 
therefore , pc 's manufacturer - installed original software will often determine the usage habits of most consumers . 
it is exactly through this measure that microsoft commands a solid control of the pc operating system market . 
now , google , microsoft 's new rival , also intends to have its finger in the pie through this means . 
a well - known economics media outfit recently used a very interesting metaphor for this . 
" dell , hewlett packard , and other computer manufacturers started to treat their computer products as supermarket shelves and charge software companies " shelving fees . " 
winning bidders can have their software appear in the 'critical ten minutes ' when users start their new computers so as to guide consumers to use their products . 
this mode of charging fees resembles the way supermarkets charge food suppliers shelving fees . " 
doubtlessly , this phenomenon indicates microsoft 's control is being loosened . 
microsoft 's managers warned bill gates that if google began to pay pc manufacturers to have their computers installed with google software when they are shipped out , then microsoft 's hegemony will eventually be threatened . 
no matter what will be the outcome of the situation , microsoft 's stable and easy days as number one may become history . 
after all , it is easier to win the throne than to keep the throne .

sword of justice : prospects for $number 
hope 
sword of justice : prospects for $number 
author : sword of justice 
i remember that at the beginning of $number , hong kong 's apple daily published an article entitled " as falun wheel revolves , its contributions rival those of government . " 
the article called $number a year of great advancement for falun gong . 
the article gave many examples of how overseas cpc officials completely lost their manners in suppressing falun gong on various occasions , while falun gong practitioners told the truth all over the world , making the cpc completely lose face . 
however , in comparison with the vast massive wave of withdrawals from the party triggered by the " nine commentaries " $date , the year $number did not seem impressive . 
- well , what will things be like $date ? 
from two incidents that occurred at the beginning of this year , we can probably see some clues about this year 's developments . 
one is the publication of " eliminating evils " by the falun gong founder . this article announced the imminent doom of those who became cpc spies after $date . 
perhaps many people are still skeptical about or cannot believe this article . 
yet , whether believing it or not , history and facts will be the proof ! 
of course , cpc spies are like rats living in the sewer . 
their " natural or accidental " deaths won 't rouse social or public attention . 
but the widespread natural elimination of or repentance by cpc spies both at home and abroad will surely produce a powerful impact and shock to the cpc power structure . 
stunned and awed by the power of natural elimination , they will have to seriously consider their route of retreat and survival - withdrawal from the party , defection , or counterattack . 
consequently , " the cpc ultra stable bureaucracy group " maintained by filthy interests will start to shake , crumble , and collapse ! 
another incident is the hunger strike protest movement initiated by gao zhisheng to safeguard human rights . 
this movement , which started suddenly and was not regarded by people as having potential at the beginning , on the contrary received an unexpectedly enthusiastic response from around the world , and a joint response from various sectors and forces at that . 
if this movement can become a tie to gather various forces of justice and the suffering masses , making it a widespread success , then there is hope that an external force will take shape from this to serve as the last straw for the unstable , evil cpc regime . 
if we say $number was a year in which the cpc was destroyed spiritually , then $number will begin a phase in which the cpc will be eliminated both spiritually and materially . 
with the further spread of the " nine commentaries " and the deepening wave of withdrawal from the party , with the internal collapse of the cpc and the convergence of external forces of justice , the life of the cpc devil will officially enter the count - down period . 
the intent of heaven and the people is harmonious ; the power of god and the people are converging . 
the giant sword is pointing directly at the cpc devil . 
if we say $number was a year of great advancement and $number was a year of surging momentum , then what will be the final conclusion for $number ? 
i hope it is stunning transformation and triumph !

xu zhiyong : a letter to li qun , linyi municipal party committee secretary 
fabuer 
sender : sunnypku ( sunny ) , 
forum : square 
subject : xu zhiyong : a letter to li qun , linyi municipal party committee secretary - hooliganism may also harm yourself 
mailing station : feel like old friends at $number meeting ( wed $date $time $number ) , this station ( yjrg.net ) 
as of yesterday the linyi government under your leadership had illegally put chen guangcheng under house arrest for $number days . 
you people have colluded with hooligans and underground society in taking illegal custody of a lawful blind citizen for a long time . 
you people have cut off the phone line in his home and installed a cell phone interference device in his courtyard . 
you people have also beat him and his family members several times . 
you people 's barbarism has exceeded the bottom line of a civilized society . 
in early $date , you people acted like hooligans in the underground society and beat attorney li fangping and me , but we put up with it , always trying our best to understand the difficulties you people are in . we even acquiesced for some time after you people put chen guangcheng under house arrest . 
however , $number days have passed . instead of refraining yourself , you people even have become more unscrupulous . 
you people dispatched regiments of police and hooligans to harass villagers . 
you people continued to detain and beat villagers . 
you people have gone too far ! 
today , as you continue to organize hooligans in the underground society to hem in chen guangcheng , i remind you explicitly that acting as hooligans in the underground society may backfire and harm yourself . 
things at the very beginning should have warranted your reconsideration . 
family planning in linyi ranked at the bottom in the entire province . 
it was understandable that you felt somewhat worried as a municipal party committee secretary . 
however , you were wrong to think that people in linyi are so crude that force must be used to implement the national law and policy . 
whose fault was it if citizens did not cooperate with the government 's action ? 
was it because citizens were crude or because the government has a poor public credibility as a result of its numerous lies and tricks over a long period of time ? 
if the same action by the government ten years ago did not appear that absurd , don 't you think your barbarous action was way out of line $date when the chinese society had achieved remarkable progress and when the human rights protection had been written into the constitution ? 
why don 't you reexamine yourself as to how it was that your linyi alone dare do such things ? 
how could it be that your linyi alone could not implement the law using the means of democratic rule of law ? 
after chen guangcheng and a number of brave citizens reported the truth about the barbarous way of implementing the law , after teng biao and a number of legal professionals daring to safeguard citizens ' rights got involved , and after the national family planning commission made the conclusion of the investigation , linyi should have offered a sincere explanation to gain the understanding of the public . 
after all , family planning is a tough subject with chinese characteristics . 
people could also have understood your difficulties . 
yet , you people instead adopted an absurd move - catching chen guangcheng in beijing and bringing him back to be locked up . you even attempted to incriminate him in the name of illegally supplying state secret intelligence . 
don 't you think this criminal charge very absurd for a blind person living in a poor mountain village ? 
in fact , as long as you people have really corrected your mistakes and as long as you people have done a good job , would you be afraid of the criticism by a blind person ? 
would you people find it necessary to dispatch $number people to watch him $time a day and even feel so exasperated as to convict him ? 
on $date , attorney li fangping and i went to dongshigu village . we made our position very clear and hoped to resolve the contradiction . 
we proposed that we could talk with your officials $number to find out what idea and request you people had . 
we offered to help you persuade chen guangcheng not to make certain remarks . 
it was our hope that you people should not treat a blind person this way and that both sides should make some concessions . 
however , your policy makers were bent on having your way , and furthermore , even " masterminded " an incident of beating and illegally detaining us . 
do you think you can scare us this way ? 
we have not done anything illegal . 
we are not afraid of anything . 
although the rule of law in china is imperfect , it is not so bad as to allow lawlessness . 
if you think you can scare us by using the tricks of hooligans in the underground society , then you have far underestimated our resolution and willpower . 
as long as we want , we have many people who have many lawful reasons to go to linyi or visit chen guangcheng . 
you can beat attorneys and scholars once , twice , and three times . each time there will be widespread attention and coverage . 
do you people dare to beat us ten times ? 
don 't you care very much about your official position ? 
in case someone is injured by beating , is your position really that secure ? 
playing some lowly tricks of hooligans instead of listening to our reasonable advice , don 't you think this is not only foolish but also risky ? 
i want to tell you clearly that in china there is a large number of excellent citizens who follow their conscience and abide by the rule of law . 
we are not afraid of hooligans and the underground society . 
we cannot tolerate the reckless trampling of the bottom line of human civilization . 
if you are going to the extreme , we will go toward your batons and sticks with confidence and ease in groups and by turns until the moment you retreat . 
you should know clearly that using the tricks of hooligans in the underground society will not be of any good to you . 
don 't think you can extricate yourself from those local ruffians and hooligans who beat up villagers as long as you stay behind the scenes . 
finally , i also want to remind you to treat chen guangcheng well . 
blind since a child , he graduated from a college of traditional medicine and taught himself law and english . he once sued the beijing subway company in the interest of the blind people , and he introduced running water for the villagers . he is known far and wide as " attorney chen . " 
you people went so far as to have shameless villains create rumors online slandering him and even attempted to convict him of a crime of supplying confidential intelligence illegally to overseas recipients . don 't you think you have gone too far by doing that ? 
it is illegal for you people to put chen guangcheng under house arrest . it is also risky to you . 
originally , you people could have released him with no trouble . 
since the barbarous implementation of the law has stopped , how long will he go on criticizing if left unchecked ? 
but , you people are now continuing to smear your own image . 
as long as cheng guangcheng is not free , you people will never have peace . 
you people have tortured him enough . 
if you even want to convict him or resort to further hooliganism , we will never look on with folded arms .

( fwd ) do chinese people deserve democracy ? 
explore road to peaceful liberation of china and advance spiritual emancipation of chinese people . 
i am very disappointed to admit that the chinese people do not deserve democracy ! 
aren 't the people posting here doing just that ? 
it is just a pity that not many people will read it online ( compared with $number ) . 
among netizens , even fewer people are concerned with or participate in topics like this . i dare say it is less than $number of netizens ! 
what 's more , this network is equipped with the golden shield , the world 's largest , most comprehensive , most advanced , most expensive , and highest quality project ! 
indeed . 
depressed , disappointed , helpless , even thinking of submission , but if i want to live a human life , who else can i count on but myself to make it happen ? 
though man proposes , god disposes ; even if i failed ... i would think that it is my fault and that i deserve to live like a dog if i have not tried hard for my own ideals . 
the very act of working hard for justice will add some beauty to my own life , at least in my own heart , in my self - appraisal . 
in fact i don 't have to worry about the future of china at all . 
that 's because the global environment has made it impossible for the existence of a regime that has not held elections for a long time . 
this is just a matter of time . 
i only lament that the chinese people have such luck that at turning points of history , they have always been led by devils of an international and monstrous stature on a road to hell along which your bones are beaten and your blood is sucked out of you . just to think that some people call glorious the bones of the dead and the puddles of blood along this road , and even force us to be proud of such glory . 
dark night falls everywhere , but it is the longest in the divine land of china . 
the qin emperor plus the sage confucius brought huge disasters to people . 
while $number qin emperor openly ruled as a tyrant , the sage confucius brainwashed in the shadows . 
it is not that the chinese people do not deserve democracy , it is that their democracy gene is gone , having been made to regress . 
for a nation that has existed for $number years , this nation should have long practiced democracy if there was an element of democracy in its national culture . 
when a democratic system was established in athens , when a republic was founded in rome , when the magna carta was approved by the british people , when the french people were issuing the declaration of the rights of man and of the citizen , and when americans were issuing the declaration of independence , what were chinese people doing ? 
before the mongols took control of the central plains , khuriltai were used to elect emperors . the manchus long ago had the council of princes and ministers to practice democratic administration . why did it all evaporate once they came to the region of the han people ? 
chinese pursue material things and are not interested at all in spiritual beliefs and political rights . 
believe it or not , at the price of a stuffed pancake , chinese people would sell you their universal suffrage if they had it . 
after half $number years , if the chinese want democracy , the earthquake will surely be coming . run if you can !

dalai 's special envoys meet with chinese officials behind closed doors 
cgp beili 
dalai 's special envoys meet with chinese officials behind closed doors . 
the dalai lama stressed that he wants autonomy , not independence , for tibet . 
the special envoys of the dalai lama , tibet 's spiritual leader in exile , are having closed - door meetings with chinese officials in beijing with no details released . 
this is $number official meeting between china and the dalai 's government - in - exile since contacts resumed $date . 
however , as always , the two sides met behind close doors with no details revealed . 
reporters said that the two sides held talks several times but so far no substantive results have been achieved . 
the dalai lama , who is in exile in northern india , said that he wants autonomy , not independence , for tibet . 
the chinese side refused to comment on the bilateral talks . 
however , analysts said that beijing wanted to have the dialogue partly because it is worried that tibetans ' dissatisfaction with the chinese rule may escalate should this $number - year - old spiritual leader in exile die . 
cultural identity 
the delegation of dalai 's government - in - exile was led by lodi gyaltsen gyari , who was also chief representative to several previous talks . 
a spokesperson for the tibetan government - in - exile said that the several rounds of talks they had with chinese officials in switzerland $date were very " close and frank , " bringing hopes for tibetans . 
the spokesperson said that their ultimate hope is to resolve the relevant issues on the basis reached through negotiation with the chinese leadership so that tibetans will have the freedom to preserve their cultural identity , which they consider important . 
cgp beili 
dalai lama 's special envoys reiterate they do not seek tibet 's independence . 
the dalai lama will go to visit washington this month . 
prior to the tibetan spiritual leader dalai lama 's visit to the united states on $date , his special envoys said that the tibetan government - in - exile would not demand for tibet 's independence . 
lodi gyaltsen gyari said in washington that he hoped the chinese government would indeed preserve tibet 's unique culture and tradition . 
during his visit to the us next week , the dalai lama is expected to discuss the tibetan issue with president bush in hopes that bush can urge the chinese government to give tibet genuine autonomy . 
dalai 's representative had direct contact with beijing officials for $number time in berne in $date of this year . 
" genuine autonomy " 
lodi gyaltsen gyari noted that in recent years the tibetan government - in - exile has seen some positive aspects when meeting with chinese authorities . 
the dalai lama 's special envoys found that beijing leaders , especially the representatives from the united front work department of the cpc central committee , were more willing than before to hear their opinions . 
however , lodi gyaltsen gyari said that the tibetan government - in - exile still has too many disagreements with the chinese government and that there is a very big difference between the positions of the two sides . 
he said that during the past five years the tibetan government - in - exile has tried its best to meet the chinese request for creating a good negotiation environment . 
china should also create a good environment for negotiations on the tibetan issue instead of suppressing the dalai lama unrelentingly . 
he said that the dalai lama does not demand independence for tibet . tibet is still part of china , but the chinese government must preserve tibet 's unique culture so that " tibetans will have genuine autonomy . " 
in addition , lodi gyaltsen gyari noted that some chinese think the tibetan issue will disappear once the dalai lama dies . 
he said that this idea is very dangerous because china will lose a historic opportunity to solve the tibetan issue once the dalai lama passes away . 
he said that as long as the chinese government responds to the requests of the dalai lama and proposes a final resolution , the dalai lama will not need to talk about the tibetan issue internationally . 
negotiation and compromise are important democratic methods ! (zt) 
houze 
i just saw a post by a net friend on the great spirit : to old mr. guiren . 
his / her original words were " negotiation and compromise are important democratic methods , or else , splitting because of disagreements is the failure of democracy ! ! ! i hope idealistic democrats will pay full attention to this point ! " 
this bland remark that has not roused interest among any net friends led me to indulge in a train of thought while all sorts of feelings welled up in my mind . 
at this time , i thought of ancient china as well as the past of the west . 
seldom posting topics , i could not help replying to the post of this net friend in the form of a topic post . 
let 's take a look $number at ancient china . 
everybody knows that beginning with $number qin emperor , china has constructed a large and unified centralized power system , with all dynasties that followed operating under this political framework . 
although a " double - track system " was temporarily implemented in the han dynasty , that is , a political system consisting of a dual coexisting feudal system and centralized power system , after all , there was still a centralized power system in the end . 
the effect of this kind of centralized power system under the conditions at that time in history had its progressive side , had its aspect of promoting the development of forces of production . 
however , we should also see that the prolonged period of $number years of running this system resulted in a lack of creativity , initiative , and activity in local areas , making it even less possible to formulate , based on local conditions , various kinds of regulations and policies appropriate for local development . 
the pyramid - like system of government also caused lower - level officials to only look upward , following every detail of orders from higher levels . 
since all local officials in the county government were appointed by the central government , they had no room for coordination and negotiation among themselves , let alone with those ordinary citizens . 
when their rights were infringed upon , peasants in ancient china could do nothing but put up with it time and again . 
only when their most basic rights were threatened , that is , when their rights of existence were deprived by widespread famine , tyranny , and natural disasters , would they rise in revolt with sharpened sticks . 
over $number years , several peasant uprisings spread like storms across the country , from the spontaneous chen sheng wu guang uprising to the plotted yellow turban uprising , to the huang chao riot in the tang dynasty , as well as the one - month dynastic rule as a result of li zicheng 's uprising . except for zhu yuanzhang , none achieved victory in the true sense of the word . 
even the ming dynasty established this way by zhu yuanzhang was still nothing but a rotating replacement of other dynasties , with no change in the system . 
born a commoner with little education , zhu yuanzhang implemented ancient china 's centralized power system to a sickening extreme . the brimming vitality characteristic of the tang dynasty , born of openness , freedom , and tolerance , was replaced by stagnant lifelessness . 
the free speech atmosphere vanished from the land of china for some time . 
human nature suffered utmost suppression . 
everyone became overcautious and dared not talk too much , from fear and trepidation . 
the result of this sole successful peasant uprising $number years turned the chinese people into subhuman beings for a period of time . 
now let 's take a look at the middle ages in western europe , known as the dark ages . 
the middle ages in western europe was a period of $number years which came about after western rome was destroyed by nomads and had nothing to do with the previous ancient greece and rome . 
this period was characterized by fiefdoms , namely land fiefdoms . 
landlords at lower levels had more independent power . 
whether they were small feudal lords with territories extending a few kilometers or the nobility of dukes , marquises , counts , viscounts , and barons who appeared on formal occasions , as people of various ranks were able to mutually check and balance and depend on one another , with the conditions and abilities to fight for their legitimate rights from the king , there were scenes of kings and noblemen sitting together for negotiations of their own respective interests , scenes never s 
they made mutual compromises and concessions instead of overthrowing or superseding other parties by using force . 
this way , by means of various kinds of contracts , rights were continuously granted to noblemen and commoners , and with increasing power for noblemen and commoners , the king 's rights became increasingly diminished . 
in the end , the british queen became only ceremonial , with no actual power . 
democracy was gradually realized through this method ! 
let 's come back to make a comparison with ancient china , with all power centralized in the hands of the emperor ( except for li shimin ) and with almost no noblemen . it would be hard for peasants to sit with the king at the negotiating table over a cup of tea and a glass of wine , making mutual compromises and concessions in a relaxed and pleasant manner and formulating contracts to the satisfaction of the two sides . 
under such circumstances , when the right of existence was deprived , the only way remaining was to overthrow the existing dynasty by force and try to replace it . 
consequently , there was a repeated rotation , from the heyday of the tang dynasty to the morbidity of the ming dynasty . 
comparing chinese history with western history , we find there seems to be no western country where conflict between the ruler and the ruled was as aggravated as it was in ancient china . 
in no western country were peasant uprisings as frequent as in ancient china . 
in western countries , when conflicts between ancient royal households and peasants arose , noblemen and commoners would $number think of achieving resolution through negotiations to protect their own interests . they would make some mutual concessions to gradually win more rights , while force was rarely used . 
understanding this , you will see that even as we enter $date , some democratic " fighters " on the internet , having inherited the idea of the ultra , absolute totalitarian system of the ming dynasty , 
and also because their bodies are eroded by the poison of the cultural revolution , these democratic " fighters " can talk about nothing except annihilation and overthrow . 
yet it is this kind of ideology that is the largest obstacle to democracy , because these people don 't understand that negotiation , consultation , and compromise are the most important methods and approaches for realizing democracy . 
cao xiaoming : who foots bill for enriching rural cultural activities ? 
houze 
this spring festival , this writer was lucky enough to spend the holiday in rural china and visit some relatives and friends . 
while impressed by the rich festive atmosphere in rural china , i was also concerned with the drab cultural activities in the countryside . 
this writer found in one village with friends and relatives that previously at spring festival each year , this village would spontaneously organize villagers to put on a local theatrical show called " revolving lantern . " 
both adults and children could play roles in this show based on characters in the three warring kingdoms . the villagers never grew tired of watching it . 
there were several performing teams for " revolving lantern " across the township . they not only performed in their own villages but also visited other villages , creating liveliness through their exchanges . 
however , this year this village no longer organized it . 
it turned out that a large sum of money was needed for purchasing costumes alone for " revolving lantern . " in the past , costumes were bought through fund raising among the villagers , yet they are now too worn out to wear . 
asking villagers door to door for money again , nobody wanted to do it . similar situations also occurred in several other villages across the township . 
without the " revolving lantern , " the village suddenly became cold and cheerless . 
adults started to play mahjong . 
children also started to play poker . 
villagers all said there was nothing going on for this new year festival . 
setting off firecrackers or playing mahjong has now become one of the major features of the new year celebration in rural areas . 
meanwhile , gambling persists in spite of numerous bans and is tending to spread further . winning or losing as much as $number yuan in a single game has even become commonplace . in particular , a large number of peasants returning from their migrant jobs outside have become major players at gambling houses . 
their money earned by their own sweat over a whole year thereby goes down the drain . 
in addition , gambling - related family disputes frequently occur . some even lead to tragedies of divorce and death . 
some peasants say they gamble not only during the new year festival , but also frequently participate in gambling during the slack season . 
there is no place to go if they don 't gamble . 
it is too difficult to organize some cultural activities , to find some fun in rural areas . 
there are neither facilities nor funds , but also there are no people acting as organizers . 
however , in this regard , what jiangxi has done is doubtlessly good news for peasants . 
in order to enrich the cultural life of the peasant population , the jiangxi provincial government , starting in $date of last year , not only implemented " theatrical performances funded by the government , operated by the market , supported by townships , provided for peasant enjoyment , " 
but is also allocating at least $number yuan annually to a special fund for rural cultural enterprises , so as to bring high - quality cultural products to the rural population . 
at the start of the new year , $number yuan was again added , bringing the total amount to $number yuan for the establishment of the special fund for rural cultural enterprise . 
moreover , the " bills " paid with this special fund are for real benefits : 
inviting various kinds of professional artistic troupes to stage performances in rural areas , with at least four performances per year in each township ; 
inviting various movie theater companies to dispatch teams to put on movies in rural areas , with at least six dramas and educational science movies per year in each administrative village ; 
organizing and carrying out mass cultural activities with local characteristics , with at least $number events per year in each township . 
from this " purchase inventory list , " it is easy for us to see that the government is not simply providing funds , but trying its best to think about how to use the limited funding to provide what is most needed and to bring value - added cultural enjoyment for the vast rural population . it has done a real job . 
currently , the vast numbers of peasants are rejoicing about being exempt from paying grain tax to the government . 
if the government can do what jiangxi did to " foot the bill " for enriching rural people 's cultural activities , it will be another joy from heaven for peasants . 
furthermore , this " joy " will not only get peasants away from the mahjong table but also get them " active " in cultural activities , which helps add contributions to the construction of new socialist rural areas . 
false alarm : wang peirong 's child almost got kidnapped 
peirongwangsohu@gmail.com 
wang peirong 's child almost got kidnapped , but it turned out to be a false alarm . 
some time after $time on $date , wang peirong 's child gave a full account : 
on the morning of $date , wang peirong 's child was called out by the entrance guard when she was attending a make - up class in physics in the xuzhou no. $number middle school . 
the entrance guard told wang peirong 's child that three unidentified men said to the no. $number middle school entrance guard , wang peirong 's child wang tianjiao has not been home for three days due to her parents ' quarrel . 
now her mother has disappeared . as we are the leaders at her mother 's workplace , we want to go inside the no. $number middle school to take away wang peirong 's child . 
wang peirong 's child said to the entrance guard that what these three men said were all lies , and she refused to go with these three men . 
with the help of the no. $number middle school entrance guard , wang peirong 's child was not taken away . 
wang peirong 's child called her mother 's leader at noon to investigate this incident , and that leader denied having sent anyone to the xuzhou no. $number middle school . 
wang peirong 's child got her father 's leader 's telephone number from her . 
wang peirong 's child called her father 's leader . 
wang peirong 's child said : " three people came to the no. $number middle scholl and wanted to take me away . " 
that leader asked : " why didn 't you go with them ? " 
wang peirong 's child answered : " i will surely die if i go with them . " 
after saying that , wang peirong 's child hung up the phone . 
after hearing what wang peirong 's child said , wang peirong felt it was a serious case and reported it to police . 
on $date , the feedback from the police station was that what wang peirong 's child had said was basically true . 
the police station asked the security department of the china university of mining and technology whether it had sent anyone to find wang peirong 's child at the no. $number middle school . the answer was no . 
the police station again asked the cumt security department whether the work unit affiliated with cumt had sent anyone to find wang peirong 's child at the no. $number middle school . the answer was another no . 
the relevant department asked others to tell wang peirong and his family to pay attention to their safety . 
after the incident , the leaders of the relevant departments in xuzhou city took it seriously . 
through the criminal investigation department of the xuzhou municipal public security bureau , the possibility of child kidnapping was ruled out . 
wang peirong thanked the leaders of the relevant departments in xuzhou city as well as the criminal investigation department of the xuzhou municipal public security bureau . 
this was a false alarm , and the false alarm was probably caused mainly by the no. $number middle school entrance guard . 
the criminal investigation department of the xuzhou municipal public security bureau has now confirmed : on $date , three people including the leader from the school of science , wang peirong 's workplace , could not find wang peirong by phone . as they urgently needed to find wang peirong ( wang peirong has so far no idea what that was about ) , they thought of going to the no. $number middle school to find the teacher of wang peirong 's child so as to ask whether the child was in xuzhou . 
heavy topics : why is there lower risk to engage in corruption while cost of anti - corruption is higher ? 
http://bbs.people.com.cn/bbs/readfile?whichfile=44796&amp;typeid=39 
with the current cadre mechanism and the anti - corruption mechanism , a corrupt official need only worry about a handful of relevant officials who supervise him rather than the vast majority of the masses . 
therefore , once he thinks he has successfully hoodwinked or balanced those few officials who can control his fate , he will feel safe in carrying out his great cause of corruption and wealth accumulation unscrupulously and at will , disregarding how the people close to him feel . 
in contrast , when ordinary people with no power in their hands take the lead in combating corruption at the sight of an injustice , they may likely be met with extremely cruel retaliation and revenge . 
or they may be also politically labeled against and may anytime suffer the fate of dying before the battle has won . 
comparing the two : those who practice corruption take less risk while those who combat corruption bear the high cost instead .

signs of bird flu emerge everywhere in europe , and people are in a panic in nigeria 
afp , brussels , $number .

the executive committee of the european union has passed a resolution for the establishment of additional " buffer area " controls , including all areas of countries where the virus has been discovered for control , and forbidding all trade and transportation of poultries and bird species .

the newly established national emergency committee stated that they have received a report that nearly $number poultries and bird species are dead in magaria , a loosely guarded area between the two countries . 
now let 's look at iran 's nuclear issue . 
the international atomic energy agency (iaea) confirmed on the $number that the iranian government had written to the agency requesting the removal of all equipments that monitor iran 's nuclear facilities by the middle of the month . 
since the iaea decided to report iran 's nuclear issue to the un security council , iran had announced the termination of all supportive and cooperative measures it had adopted in the nuclear issue , and refused to allow the iaea to conduct any further surprise inspections of its nuclear facilities . 
speaking on the tension in iran 's nuclear issue , russia 's foreign minister lavrov stated in athens , greece , on the $number that the collaboration between russia and iran still exists . 
this will be the driving force in resolving iran 's nuclear issue . 
a spokesman for russia 's ministry of foreign affairs claimed on the same day that russia 's proposal to iran on building a joint uranium enrichment enterprise in russia is still effective . 
the two parties may hold discussions on this issue next week . 
on the same day , lugar , the u.s. senate foreign relations committee chairman , indicated at the un headquarters in new york that the united states disagreed with israel 's attack on iran 's nuclear facilities . 
recent reports claimed that israeli defense experts said that the israeli air force may deliver a heavy blow to iran 's nuclear facilities if necessary . 
the xinhua news agency reported that kislyak , russia 's deputy foreign minister , stated on the $number that russia is willing to cooperate with iran on the nuclear issue , assisting iran to obtain the legitimate right to peacefully develop nuclear power . 
kislyak said that russia 's proposal on a joint uranium enrichment enterprise with iran is still effective . 
russia hopes to discuss the issue with iran soon . 
russia submitted a proposal to iran on building a joint uranium enrichment enterprise in russia at the end of last $date . 
the european union and the united states both indicated that they could accept this compromise plan . 
iran hopes that russia can continue to revise the original plan . 
kong quan , spokesman for china 's ministry of foreign affairs , said on the $number that even though the iaea had reported iran 's nuclear issue to the un security council , it had not shifted its responsibility to handle iran 's nuclear issue to the un security council . 
thus , all parties still have to break the stalemate of iran 's nuclear issue within the iaea 's framework . 
according to the iaea resolution , the agency 's director - general elbaradei will submit a report on iran 's nuclear issue to the un security council in $date . 
the un security council will make a final decision after evaluating the report . 
we believe this resolution is asking iran to fulfill its obligations and commitments , but it is not transferring the iaea 's responsibility on handling the iran nuclear issue to the un security council . 
recently , china has been seeking peaceful resolutions to iran 's nuclear problem through diplomatic channels for some time . 
kong quan said that zhang yan , director - general of china 's department of arms control and disarmament at the foreign ministry , had held talks on iran 's nuclear issue with larijani , secretary of iran 's supreme national security council and chief negotiator , in tehran on $date . 
china hopes that iran will take great stock in the emphasis of the international community and create conditions for a peaceful solution to iran 's nuclear issue . 
to solve the iranian nuclear issue within the iaea framework serves not only china 's interest , but also the interest of all parties concerned . 
therefore , we again call on the parties concerned in the international community not to quit the diplomatic effort that has been conducted on this issue .

russia had shown its support for iran 's peaceful utilization of nuclear power , and stated that it would insist on not handing over iran 's nuclear issue to the un security council . 
however , we saw that they have already agreed to hand over iran 's nuclear issue to the un security council . 
now that we have such a new development , we may therefore amend the previous agreement we reached with russia . 
before the un security council makes its final decision on whether to impose economic and political sanctions on iran in $date , iran suggests holding continuous talks with relevant international organizations . it is also willing to cooperate with the international community in order to alleviate the current crisis . 
we stress that iran will not give up the rights to peaceful use of nuclear power in order to strive for our economic development and the building of our country . 
iran has not violated relevant international law . we hope that the united states can understand . 
iran 's nuclear issue is completely different from the afghani and iraqi issues . 
i think the united states is also clear on this . 
as for the so - called military attack , we have not seen a clear position from the united states . 
we do not want to see the escalation of the crisis . 
we also emphasize the use of peaceful negotiations , but we will not succumb to pressure . 
in addition , ( ( agabi ) ) stated that he hoped that china will continue its cooperation with iran based on its original position .

xiaonan .

thank you xiaoying for the latest coverage from the united states . 
since there is no other means , all we can do is relax and enjoy this beautiful snow scene . 
let 's look at some news on japan . 
er , koizumi has always wanted to upgrade the japanese defense agency to a ministry to increase japan 's military power . 
however , intense debates have been created during the course , and it is full of twists and turns . 
recently , scandals surfaced during the bidding , during the bidding on construction projects at the defense facilities administration agency under japan 's defense agency , leading to the arrest of existing and former officials . 
therefore , many people advised koizumi to be careful in the course of upgrading the agency to a ministry . 
well , koizumi stated recently that he will temporarily shelve the plan and will not submit it to the cabinet for deliberation for the time being . 
well , he hopes that the two ruling parties will carefully discuss this issue and er , continue the discussion . 
another bit of news is that if you go to japan , there is a new regulation . 
japan plans to require the majority of the tourists , visitors visiting japan , to have their fingerprints and pictures taken . 
this is to prevent dangerous figures from entering japan and to avoid illegal immigrants . 
er , therefore , it should be more inconvenient to go to japan now . 
well , of course , there is good news in japan recently . 
kiko , the wife of japan 's $number prince , is pregnant . 
the pregnancy has led to the hope of many japanese that she will give birth to a son to inherit the throne . 
however , she has also stirred up some waves in the imperial family , which has been relatively quiet . 
er , in fact , kiko is definitely an older pregnant woman . moreover , people had always believed that she was happy with a four - person household . 
for her to get pregnant again at such an age , many people cannot help but to speculate that , er , a fight for the throne between the two brothers may be unfolding in the imperial family . 
of course , many people take delight in talking about this conspiracy theory . 
they claim that this incident may be traced back to a few years ago . 
er , this is how it goes . it was $date when the wife of the eldest prince naruhito was diagnosed with depression . as a result , the imperial family did not invest too much hope in them , and pressured $number eldest prince akishino in turn . 
akishino did not have too much of a response at the time . 
however , $date , the conflict was intensified because naruhito , er , was eager to protect his wife and um , criticized the imperial family in public . 
well , allegedly , the imperial family was furious at that time and requested $number - eldest prince akishino , who is of the same generation as naruhito , to come forward to refute his brother , saying that his doting on his wife was a disrespect to the imperial family . 
since then , the brothers have been at odds . 
now , if $number - eldest prince akishino has a boy , well , then their spindle will become a pillar of the imperial family , 
while the crown prince , who is also the eldest prince , will thus decline for sure . 
er , therefore , many people say that it will have a great impact on the imperial family and japanese society . 
annan , the un secretary - general , met with us president bush on monday at the white house . 
in regard to iran 's announcement of postponing its nuclear negotiations with russia , annan urged iran to stop its nuclear activities as soon as possible and to resolve the issue through negotiations and not resistance . 
moreover , there is news that the us department of defense has begun to work closely on the plan to bomb iran as a last resort if diplomatic efforts fail . 
initially , the outside believed that bush and annan would discuss the possibility of the un security council imposing sanctions on iran , but the two did not make public the discussions in this area after the meeting . 
both bush and annan reiterated that they hoped to resolve iran 's nuclear issue through talks . 
annan expressed his worries over iran 's launching of enriched uranium activities and its decision to postpone the nuclear talks with russia . 
on the same day , the us media reported that military strategists at the pentagon have begun to work closely on the plan to take military actions against iran in case diplomatic efforts fail and the united states uses military means to prevent iran from developing nuclear weapons . 
according to the report , commanders at the us central command have started ascertaining the targets of attack . 
the attack may be by means of the launch of ballistic missiles from submarines and air raids from b2 bombers . 
annan appealed monday for all parties to refrain from taking actions that will escalate the crisis . 
military specialists analyzed that iran may be capable of producing nuclear weapons in two years . 
bush has more than two years remaining in his $number term . 
he will strive to resolve iran 's nuclear issue during his term of office , whether it is through peaceful or military means . 
mou naiqian , phoenix tv , washington . 
iranian president ahmadinejad stated on the $number that superpowers that use their own weapons to threaten other nations will soon disappear . 
ahmadinejad met with diplomatic envoys from other countries in tehran at the commemoration of the $number anniversary of the victory of the islamic revolution . 
he indicated that the arms race and the fight for supremacy among nations will not produce any result . 
the superpowers ' appetite will never be satisfied . they even use weapons to threaten other nations . 
however , he claimed that superpowers that rely on weapons to threaten other nations will soon disappear . 
the day when mankind can enjoy eternal peace and stability will soon arrive . 
thus , we can see that it is not only a fight of words ; in fact , the increasingly explosive situation between iran and the western world , with the united states , is becoming more intense . 
due to the mutually unyielding positions between iran and the united states , some recent changes have appeared in which iran officially announced the resumption of its enriched uranium refining program two days ago . 
in fact , some western diplomats have speculated that iran might have actually resumed some enriched uranium refining procedures before that . 
in addition , iran announced that it will postpone the talks with russia indefinitely , the negotiations on russia refining enriched uranium for iran . 
well , of course , the indefinite postponement of the negotiation plan is decided under the new development of the situation . 
recently , due to the continuous threat of the united states to attack iran , a british think - tank - the oxford research institute - has issued such a report . 
if the united states resorts to force , half the people will die . moreover , it will definitely touch off um , continue the wave of violence in the middle east this year . 
in addition , some terrorist attacks will be intensified . 
of course , oil prices will skyrocket ; which is also among the series of domino effects . 
the report also stated that if the united states fails to force iran into compliance , it will definitely accelerate iran 's determination to produce nuclear weapons by itself . 
we just mentioned the russia - iran negotiation issue . 
the iranian official spokesman indeed stated on monday that due to the emergence of the new situation , it will postpone the negotiations with russian officials on the refining of enriched uranium in russia originally scheduled for the $number . 
a spokesman for russia 's ministry of foreign affairs said that it had not received any formal notification from the iranian authorities . 
it is still too early to tell if the meeting will continue . 
moreover , yusufov , minister of atomic energy for the russian federation and minister of energy for russia , stated on monday that russia is prepared for talks with iran to discuss the conditions and principles of the nuclear issue . 
meanwhile , the new york times based in the united states recently issued an editorial . 
the headline of the editorial was also very conspicuous . it was titled ' japan 's offensive foreign minister . ' 
the editorial specifically mentioned that japan 's foreign minister taro aso had made a string of appalling remarks recently . 
these statements were all very dishonest and unwise . moreover , they had provoked a general rage in asian countries . 
the editorial particularly mentioned that japan should acknowledge and learn from its own mistakes , instead of avoiding to mention what it did during $number world war in its teaching materials after the war , as it is currently doing . 
at the same time , the editorial also claimed that many of taro aso 's statements , such as requesting the prime minister to visit the yasukuni shrine , and that taiwan 's colonial rule had heightened um , oh , japan 's colonial rule had heightened the um , educational standard in taiwan , remarks like these were appalling . moreover , it was obvious that he lacks knowledge of history and has poor diplomatic sense . 
the new york times was $number - largest circulated newspaper in the united states last year , so it should be very influential in us society . 
thus , this editorial should create a huge impact . 
meanwhile , um , former senior us government officials and experts specialized in asian issues in the united states recently held a special symposium - a symposium on the sino - japanese relations . 
some experts put forward this argument at the symposium . 
they said that the sino - japanese relation is very tense right now , with the potential danger of a military clash . 
moreover , they even claimed that the possibility of an outbreak of a um , military clash between china and japan is even higher than one between the two sides of the taiwan straits . 
er , once a military clash breaks out , the united states will be dragged into the mire because it will definitely be drawn into it . 
a spokesman for japan 's ministry of foreign affairs , who participated in the symposium , said that the sino - japanese relation is currently at a very tense stage . 
any mistake will lead to serious consequences . 
in addition , the parliamentary committees on defense and security of the georgian parliament held an enlarged session and decided to drive out russian peacekeeping troops in the south ossetia area . 
the russian parliament will hold a general assembly today to deliberate on this motion . 
er , experts argued that if the parliament carries the motion to expel the russian peacekeeping troops , it will lead to a fundamental rupture of the georgian - russian relationship . 
a spokesman for the russian peacekeeping troops stated on the $number that two russian peacekeeping troops food transport vehicles were blocked by the georgian police , and the drivers were driven away . 
er , the spokesman demanded georgia to stop such provocations immediately ; otherwise , russia will not be responsible for the consequences . 
two provisions and non - staple food military vehicles under the russian peacekeeping troops logistics system were interrogated by the georgian police in the south ossetia area on monday night . 
the georgian police officers on duty expelled the russian drivers , and the escort personnel then drove the two military vehicles away by force . 
the incident had infuriated the russian peacekeeping troops . 
a spokesman for the russian peacekeeping troops said that the georgian police used a traffic accident as an excuse to detain a russian military vehicle on $date , and has not returned it so far . 
on $date , they held three russian officers in custody for two days and two nights on the pretext of a visa issue . 
the ruthless provocations of georgia is in hopes that it will create bloodshed in this area and force the russian troops to open fire , so that it can achieve the aim of making the peacekeeping troops withdraw from south ossetia . 
the russian embassy in georgia lodged serious statements with georgia on that day , demanding that georgia stop its desperate provocations immediately . otherwise , russia will not bear the responsibilities of any clashes resulting from it . 
the media indicated that on $date , okruashvili , georgia 's minister of defense , announced that leaders at the russian military base in akhalkalaki had sold several ' strela - type ' missiles for use with self - propelled anti - aircraft missile systems to south ossetia . 
the parliamentary committees on defense and security of the georgian parliament held an enlarged session on that day to listen to reports from law enforcement departments , and decided to expel the russian peacekeeping troops in georgia , and requested the parliamentary assembly scheduled on the $number to deliberate on this issue . 
experts believe that once the final decision is made , it may lead to the final fundamental breakdown of the georgian - russian relationship . 
earlier , georgian foreign minister bezhuashvili fiercely criticized russia 's position , refuting russian president putin 's statement that if the west recognizes kosovo , then russia may recognize abkhazia and south ossetia , arguing that russia is sending encouraging signals to all the separatist regions . 
russia 's ministry of foreign affairs also declared earlier that it will protect the russian citizens in south ossetia , which implied the threat of direct force toward georgia .

the u.s. army hopes to conduct another joint military exercise with the chinese people 's liberation army . 
the declaration immediately raised concern among u.s. defense experts . 
the heritage foundation held a seminar wednesday on the pentagon 's defense evaluation report . 
the subtle relations between the defense report and the military exercise had become one of the discussion topics . 
some people argued that roughead 's open invitation for china to participate in the military exercise is a friendly gesture by the united states toward china . 
while extending its invitation to china for its participation in a military exercise , the u.s. army also indicated its hope for more transparent operations by the chinese people 's liberation army . thus , some defense experts argued that it is a sign that the pentagon cannot fathom china 's intentions in expanding its military power , and hopes to learn about the real situation and feel each other out through a joint military exercise . 
moreover , since the defense evaluation report released by the pentagon at the beginning of the month had considered china as the biggest potential threat in the future , thus , two defense experts also pointed out that the asian - pacific military exercise will be $number step for the u.s. department of defense to adjust its strategy on this basis . 
xie xiaoshuang , phoenix tv , washington . 
in addition , the wide attention given to this um , summertime military exercise by the united states is also because this will be $number time in $number years that the united states has four um , aircraft carriers participating in a military exercise together . it is also $number time since the vietnam war that the united states has dispatched the aircraft carrier on the east coast to take part in such a military exercise in the um , western pacific region .

this is a news roundup by phoenix tv . 
let 's look at a few japanese news items . 
there is a rather shocking piece of news in japanese politics recently . 
tsuneo watanabe , president of the yomiuri shimbun , a leading outlet in japan 's media , instructed the yomiuri shimbun to publish um , articles criticizing koizumi 's visit to the yasukuni shrine . since then , the yomiuri shimbun has held the same position on the matter . 
er , well , um , tsuneo watanabe railed against koizumi in um , his speech a few days ago , calling him very ignorant , and that he does not know any history or culture . 
he also equated the visitation of the yasukuni shrine to the glorification of hitler . he added that such an act by koizumi has made china and korea consider japan as an extremely dangerous nation , which will cause endless trouble . 
why would tsuneo watanabe 's position create huge shock waves ? 
in fact , he is very influential in politics and has always been a hidden hand . 
he had been a far rightist in the past . 
he had supported the hawks and aggressively promoted the revision of the constitution . 
however , it is a um , huge turn now . 
he has turned the cannon around to start bombing koizumi and opposing such a position . 
actually , $date when people criticized koizumi for visiting the yasukuni shrine , um , tsuneo watanabe still claimed that , he claimed that he supported koizumi , and asked him to stand up to the pressure . 
nonetheless , he made a speech recently saying , " i 'll be $number years old this year . i have very little time left . " 
well , now he comes forward and makes anti - war speeches in a lofty tone . 
his change in um , allegiance no doubt creates a huge impact on japanese , um society . 
as tsuneo watanabe put it himself , " i believe i have the confidence and the ability to change the political situation . " 
he added that if the government exerts pressure on the freedom of speech and assembly and the editorial freedom of the yomiuri shimbun , he would risk his life to resist . 
then , what kind of situation has been formed now ? 
japan 's largest newspaper , the yomiuri shimbun , and its $number largest newspaper , um , the % pw asahi shimbun , the two major newspapers have joined hands in opposing koizumi 's visit to the yasukuni shrine . 
originally , the two major newspapers were two opposing groups . however , after the two presidents met , at least they had reached a consensus on this matter . 
thus , they both adopt strong offensives in um , railing against koizumi . it can be said that they have formed a dream team . 
in fact , these two major newspapers have huge , um , influence on the mainstream public opinion in japan . 
moreover , let us look at the meeting of the um , house of representatives in japan . in a recent meeting , the same remark was made by the top two successor candidates um , of um , japan 's prime minister junichiro koizumi . 
who were these two people ? 
% pw one was shinzo abe , chief cabinet secretary , and the other was taro aso , japan 's foreign minister , who has repeatedly made um , shocking remarks in recent days . 
what remark did both of them make ? 
they both said that japan 's war criminals of $number world war were not criminals . 
what they meant was that er , it was the international court that called them um , criminals and convicted them . 
while in japan , according to international laws , according to japanese laws , er , the war criminals had not broken any japanese laws . 
thus , they argued that war criminals of $number world war should not be considered as criminals in japan . 
in the meantime , um , shinzo abe mentioned that japan should now have the whole world in view and develop its relationship with the united states and business and trading ties with um , east asian countries . moreover , it should develop close ties with india instead of focusing on china all the time .

china 's experts : " china 's military threat " touted by the united states is an unreasonable accusation . 
xinhua news agency , beijing , $date ( reporters : li xuanliang , xiong zhengyan , lin liping ) . the quadrennial defense review formally submitted by the united states pentagon to the congress a few days ago $number calls china " a newly arisen power that is most likely to challenge the united states militarily . " 
experts think that this is an unreasonable accusation against china 's normal defense construction , and an interference in china 's internal affairs by exaggerating the " theory of china 's military threat . " 
the quadrennial defense review is a new guidance document for national defense of the pentagon . 
this $number - page report uses three paragraphs to discuss the issue of china 's military strength and how the united states should cope with it . the report directly mentions the two terms of " china " and " chinese " $number times , and says that , " as a major newly arisen power , china has the most military potential to compete with the united states ; if the united states does not take any countermeasures , china is very likely to develop destructive military technology , and break the us supremacy o 
yao yunzhu , a research fellow at the world 's military study office of china 's military science academy , said that although senior us officials expressed similar views before , this is $number time for the united states to come up with the idea that " china is most likely to challenge the united states militarily as a newly arisen power " in a defense strategy report . 
" this report $number regards russia , india , and china as newly arisen strategic rivals , and especially , pays more attention to the so - called 'theory of china 's military threat , ' "

the noticeable thing is that on the same day when the quadrennial defense review was submitted , us president bush also presented his administrative budget for the $number fiscal year to the congress , and the defense budget is as high as $number dollars in the budget . 
" if the budget for military activities in iraq and afghanistan is added , the defense budget for the us in the $number fiscal year will break the historical record of $number dollars , " said peng guangqian . " and this almost amounts to the sum of military expenses of all the countries in the world . " 
peng guangqian thinks that the us method of making " theories of threats from other countries " reflects its consistent style of " making enemies , " and its real goal is to strive for more defense funds and fish for more profits for the us 's gigantic defense industry groups .

deng hongzhou , a military expert who has participated in the writing of the china defense white paper many times , said that since $date of $date , with the economic development , china 's defense funding has been increased to some extent , but it tends to fall in its ratio to the state 's financial expenditure in the same periods .

china 's defense funding $date was rmb $number yuan , which only amounts to $number of that of the us ; military expense per capita is only equal to $number of that of the us ; and military expense per serviceman is about only $number of that of the us armed forces . 
" the us land area is about as big as china 's , but the gap in military expenditures between ( the two countries ) is so huge that there is no need to point out whose military strength indeed exceeds the needs of a justifiable defense , " 
said peng guangqian . 
teng jianqun , director of the study office at china 's armament control and disarmament association , said that the us side should objectively comment on china 's military construction , and china 's peaceful development does not mean that china and the united states will become military rivals in the future . 
china 's defense white paper $number says that china firmly follows the path of peaceful development and implements a defensive policy of national defense . 
china never threatened or threatens or will threaten any countries .

( international observation ) hamas seeks breakthrough in organization of its cabinet 
xinhua news agency , ramallah , $date ( international observation ) . hamas seeks breakthrough in organization of its cabinet 
xinhua news agency reporters : wang hao and huang min 
how the palestinian islamic resistance movement ( hamas ) draws the blueprint for its $number government after it won the legislative committee election has become the focus that the international community is currently paying attention to . 
what kind of a new policy hamas is going to carry out will directly affect the next appropriate policy direction of every party concerned in the peace process . 
at the same time , the boycott attitude of the united states and israel has made the prospect of the hamas government more uncertain . 
currently , all the parties in palestine are consulting each other tensely , and actively looking for breakthroughs in difficulties and sensitive aspects in future development of the cabinet organization . 
( subtitle ) who will be selected to take the position of prime minister ? 
some outsiders worry that a " hamas prime minister " might have disagreements with abbas , the current supreme leader , after hamas wins the right to organize its cabinet . 
moreover , a hamas leader , mushir , who is visiting egypt , stressed that a new palestinian government established by hamas leadership will not acknowledge israel . this strong signal has also raised more international concerns . 
the united states and israel have clearly stated that they do not accept a hamas government that controls real power , and threatened to stop their economic aid to palestine and suspend transferring tax income to the palestinian side . 
however , these things do not hinder hamas from adjusting its strategy flexibly . selection of an independent candidate is one compromise . 
as it has been reported , to win maximum acknowledgement internationally , the hamas leaders from home and abroad who gathered in egypt a few days ago , had decided to select jamal al - khudairi , an independent person who is the chair of the board of gaza islamic university , to be the new prime minister . 
this move has not been responded to by related parties . 
hussein , a palestinian analyst , said that no matter who is selected as the prime minister , the most important thing is to soften the " strong " attitude of hamas as much as possible on the selection of the candidate for prime minister , and only in this way can it assure the success of the cabinet organization . 
( subtitle ) how to allocate power 
the biggest challenge for hamas in organizing its cabinet is that it lacks sufficient administrative experience from the perspective of its internal capabilities . 
an article published by the palestinian daily journal analyzed that although hamas has won support from people through social welfare items , it lacks administrative experience , and a better strategy is to collaborate with the palestinian national liberation movement ( fatah ) , which has administrative experience . 
hamas suggested to establish a " political partnership " with fatah to organize a national coalition government after the election , but fatah has not actively responded to it so far . 
inside fatah , there are now different opinions on whether it should join the cabinet ; some think it should join the new government to play a role in it ; some refuse the invitation from hamas and would rather become an " active opposition " in the legislative committee . 
a well - informed source pointed out that fatah is gradually leaning toward joining the new government after abbas 's persuasion . 
even so , fatah will bargain with hamas on the allocation of cabinet positions . 
moreover , another path is to establish a cabinet that is out of the framework of the legislative committee and free of partisan leanings . 
as it has been reported , hamas has also designed a pure technocratic government , but the concrete name list of the government is unknown . 
because of the attitude of the united states and israel , a technocratic government is a cabinet organization method that can reduce external pressure . 
according to regulations of the palestinian " essential law , " nomination of the prime minister and the cabinet organization work will be completed within $number weeks after a new legislative committee assumes office on the $number of this month . 
( subtitle ) where does the armed wing go ? 
another difficult issue for organization of a new government is the weapons in the hands of hamas . 
the attitude of the united states and israel is very strong , and they firmly request that hamas give up violence , and refuse its joining the government with its weapons . 
hamas leader mushir stressed on the $number that the armed resistance is the " strategic choice " of the organization . 
the armed wing issue includes two aspects of weapons ' legitimacy and ownership and control of armed wings . 
hamas is acknowledged internationally because it becomes $number big party elected in the legislative committee through a democratic and free method , and the legitimatized path for its armed wing , the qassam brigades , is to integrate it into a security organization for the government . 
hamas used to suggest integrating military wings of all factions into a " people 's army " under the palestinian national authority , but it has not received broad responses , and has even been criticized by the palestinian islamic organization ( jihad ) . 
palestine currently has $number personnel in security organizations , and most of them come from the fatah camp . 
moreover , fatah has some armed wings and keeps loose organizational relations with them , such as the " al - aqsa martyr brigades " and " fatah hawks , " etc. 
hamas , responsible for the cabinet organization , must make an agreement with abbas on how to control those self - governed armed wings and reasonably allocate security and administrative power . 
as local media reported , abbas tends to control security and intelligence troops ; organizations such as the police and civilian defense can be administrated by the internal affairs ministry of a new government . 
however , all parties concerned are still consulting each other on this sensitive issue , and have not produced any results .

( winter olympic games : stimulant ) news analysis : pyleva incident might be settled by leaving it unsettled 
xinhua news agency , turin , $date . news analysis : pyleva incident might be settled by leaving it unsettled 
xinhua news agency reporters : gao peng , ding ying 
although italy reiterated that any athletes who are discovered using stimulants may face the " disaster of being jailed , " many cases currently demonstrate that it is unlikely to happen to russian women 's biathlon athlete olga pyleva , who is at the center of $number scandal over stimulant use at the winter olympic games . 
$number stimulant use scandal at the turin winter olympic games was exposed on the $number , and olga pyleva was discovered to have used the illegal and banned drug carphedon . 
the next day , the international olympic committee announced that pyleva had been thrown out of the winter olympic games , and the silver medal she won for the $number km women 's biathlon had been withdrawn . 
the same day , the international winter biathlon alliance determined to forbid pyleva to participate in the sport for two years . 
the international olympic committee has been implementing the regulation that once athletes are discovered using stimulants , they will lose their qualification to participate in the games , and the scores they achieved will be withdrawn , but they are not subject to legal punishment . 
however , according to italian law , the carrying and use of stimulants by any athlete are criminal activities . a law enforcement organization has the right to directly arrest and investigate any athlete who uses stimulants . any violators of the law are subject to jail for $number months to $number years . 
the international olympic committee had been " bargaining " with the italian government for one year , and eventually reached an agreement last $date . both sides agreed that during the period of the winter olympic games , any athletes who use stimulants would be handled according to italian laws . 
through the unremitting efforts made by the international olympic committee , the italian side made a compromise four days before the opening ceremonies of the winter olympic games , and promised that the police would not enter the olympic village to search athlete residences during the olympic games . but any athletes whose drug tests show positive will be investigated by italian prosecution organizations . 
some reports said that pescante , an official of the italian government responsible for supervision of the turin winter olympic games , has transferred pyleva 's stimulant case to a turin prosecution organization . 
however , the international olympic committee and pescante himself have not confirmed this so far . 
andrey dmytriev , a doctor for the russian biathlon team , disclosed at noontime on the $number that pyleva had left turin and returned home . 
shi kangcheng , a chinese sports official who had been in a position at the world anti - stimulant organization for many years , thinks that once pyleva returns home , this case might eventually " be settled by leaving it unsettled . " 
shi kangcheng said that the international olympic committee and the italian government have not " completely addressed " the anti - stimulant issue at the winter olympic games , and it is hard to say what the outcome would be even if italian prosecution organizations really did get involved in the case . 
based on past penalty cases in which italy sentenced or punished its own athletes who used stimulants , the most serious penalty was merely a " two - year probation . " 
thus , senior reporter piali from the italian ansa said that the possibility of pyleva being jailed is " very small , " and at most , she might be fined . 
piali also said that although an italian court could sentence her by default , it is impossible for the italian police to catch pyleva abroad and bring her back to serve the sentence . 
if pyleva refuses to accept the sentence , the italian side can do nothing about it .

as the foreign trade and economic bureau of quanzhou city estimated , the reason why the foreign trade for quanzhou grew rapidly in $date is because it had benefited from several foreign trade support services and measures taken by quanzhou ; enterprises were very enthusiastic about promoting exports ; economic operations in quanzhou were thriving ; enterprises raised their confidence in running businesses ; and there was a highly efficient and unblocked environment for development of 
championship hopeful but not a sure thing 
loving life and luneng 
the gunpowder smoke of the chinese super cup soccer game will soon bring flames of war . 
the luneng team of taishan is ready for the new game season , and is preparing to rush to the championship again . 
the battles for seizing dominance among lian , lu , and hu , the three strong teams , will break out at any moment . 
who will win the championship at last ? 
based on an analysis of actual strengths , although the taishan team has a great hope of seizing the championship , it has no full certainty of success . 
$number , the time for new team members to adapt to each other is short . 
the taishan team had nothing new last year . 
the taishan team introduced li leilei and wang liang , the two members from the national team , this year . soon after that , it will also add two members to the team from foreign teams , and its actual strength should be seen as increased , not reduced . 
but because the national team is preparing for the matches with the palestinian and iraqi teams , those members of the national team cannot coordinate with the members of this team . 
when they return to the football club , the league matches will start right away , 
so , the issue of adapting to each other is the biggest issue the taishan team is facing . 
i think that those members from the national team can be substitute players for $number several rounds of games in the league matches . 
firstly , they can be trained to adapt to the team in matches ; 
secondly , those national team members who have played two group matches can have a rest . 
after several rounds of matches , their edge would be honed , and it won 't be too late for them to participate . 
$number , its defense has hidden problems . 
the defense of the taishan team was scolded as a sick one by its fans last year . 
li leilei was introduced this year , and has improved the defense , but the team has not reached the time for sitting back and relaxing . 
the problem of center halfbacks ' and fullbacks ' slowness in turning back still exists , and those substitute players are either older in age or lack experience . 
if center halfbacks and fullbacks can solidly play their roles , the taishan team would have one more advantage in its path to seizing the championship . 
i think that it does not hurt to use ren yongshun who has good physical qualities , although lacking experience . he can exercise this year in preparation for the future . 
and also , it is ok to withdraw gao rao to play fullback . 
many members of the taishan team can play fullback , including cui peng and hai bin . 
gao rao is strong physically , and can aggressively and fiercely intercept the ball , and should be able to do a good job in the position of either center halfback or fullback . 
$number , whether foreign players can adapt to the team . 
the introduction of foreign players is a big issue that has been puzzling the taishan team . 
nobody dares to say anything good about dan qiu 's performance last year . 
it is known that foreign players have not been selected for introduction for this year . 
i think that in addition to introduction of an outstanding forward , a very good left - foot forward should be introduced too . 
except xing rui , who played on the taishan team several years ago , there has not been a real left - foot player on the team . 
although some players like cui peng can play the role , a real left - foot forward would be much better than one who is a guest player . 
if these three issues can be solved well , the path for the taishan team to seize the championship should be somewhat smoother . 
as a shandong football fan , i really hope that the taishan team will be able to seize the championship this year . 
but frankly speaking , the taishan team is very hopeful , but has no full guarantee of winning the championship this year . 
baidi ad incorporated into jwt network ; is it too late now to say happy new year ? 
brandvista post : 
how is everyone ? 
the spring festival has passed us again like this , and friends who combined vacations with the spring festival holidays have gradually returned to their posts . 
we wish all friends a happy new year , if it is not too late to say happy new year now . 
on that day i chatted with nplcn in a cafe ; he mentioned that the present geometry brand 
website looks much prettier . 
good from contents to formats . 
his most favorite is the recent thoroughly innovated bbs that is based on discuz community . 
as for the community , i have to thank someone . 
he is mr. li mingshun , the general manager of discuz beijing corporation . 
a heap of results can be found if you search his name on google . 
you probably know that he was at sina.com , and later he himself created a business , and established an internet advertisement exchange platform for small and medium - size enterprises , similar to adbrite.com abroad . 
he debated on msn at that time . his rough idea is that : geometry feels that the development of many of china 's industries depends on the strength of private economy and small and medium - size enterprises . 
but in china 's present market , this situation cannot make people optimistic . 
so , intellectual trades , similar services , and consultation of small and medium - size enterprises cannot form sizable ones . 
collection of higher fees for their own development will eventually bring a pessimistic cycle . 
he later went to discuz . 
discuz is an excellent community program based on php and mysql databases . 
with the help of ramboo , a technical engineer from beijing , geometry brand 's community is finally seeing the light again , and is stepping on stage with a very fresh face . 
the feedback is very good . 
the interface is clean and friendly . 
speed is quite quick . 
i 'm starting to feel a kind of joy at writing words that make myself aware of something and inspire others , and communicate with friends who pursue the same thing in the same trade about small things in our work and life in a very clean interface . 
thanks discuz ! 
there is a lot of news in the advertisement field . 
the system on opening advertisement trade regulated by the wto is starting to be implemented from the beginning of $date . 
all of the big laowai ( old foreigners ) have arrived on the site , one after another , and small laowai are sharpening their knives noisily . it seems to be prosperous everywhere . 
baidi advertising out of singapore has many troubles . 
sir martin is finally finding a little time away from the lawsuit in italy to consider shuffling the deck after losing some heavyweight customers and continuous development setbacks on the mainland . 
baidi advertising and batey will be incorporated into jwt network and maintain their brands , and will be managed by jwt . 
and at the same time , some rumors say that bates and $number networks will be incorporated into the aomei system , and will be managed by aomei advertising network . 
although $number has been returned to aomei before , it is still an interesting thing to let da pisi return to aomei . 
websites have updated many articles during the spring festival . we don 't need to mention every one of them here . 
if everybody has time , he or she can check websites . 
at the same time , friends who have not participated in the new forum can click the mouse one more time without any trouble , and enter into the totally new geometry brand community . 
feel the environment , experience the atmosphere , and contribute your words . 
hope you 'll be happy for finding the organization . 
we wish every friend a beautiful mood . 
best wishes !

mom of ten years ago 
helen li 
read this article , and wanted to share it with people . 
this is not an impulsion , but warmness and kindness staying in my heart for a long time . 
i ask myself if it were me , what i would do . 
the answer is very clear . i would hang up the phone , " you dialed a wrong number . " 
this year i have been thinking about what really counts for helping people . 
i have given up tentative conduct , such as donations of cash or items . 
some friend said a couple of days ago that he has no time to take care of himself , not mention to help people , even though his desire for providing help is bigger than his ability . 
wish you a happy day : )

mom of ten years ago 
it was one day ten years ago when this teacher was taking a nap by using the rest time at noon . suddenly , the phone rang . 
she picked up the phone , and heard a strange and rude voice : " your child stole a book , and we caught her . come and hurry up ! " 
the crying noise of a little girl and denouncing voices from others came out of the handset . 
she understood the thing immediately when she turned her head and looked at her only daughter , who was watching tv . 
there must be a little girl who was caught by the saleswoman for stealing a book . she does not want her family members to know this , so she made up a phone number , and a phone call happens to come here . 
she could of course hang up the phone and give no response , and even scold the other side . 
because this thing has nothing to do with her . 
but she herself is a teacher ; maybe that girl is one of her pupils . 
she could probably imagine through the phone that that little girl , who made a wrong decision at that moment , must be very panicked , and may be facing the most terrible situation of her life . 
after she hesitated for a moment , she suddenly had an idea in her mind . yes , i will do it this way . 
then , she asked for the detailed address of the bookstore , and hurried there . 
as she expected , a little girl with tear stains all over her face was standing in the bookstore . 
and those adults standing around were scolding her ferociously in loud voices . 
she rushed to the poor little girl and held her in her arms , and turned her head to the sales clerks around , and said : " talk to me if you have something to say . do not terrify the child . " 
she took the little girl with her and walked out of the bookstore after she paid out several dozen yuan as a fine , while the sales clerks were whispering reluctantly . then , she could clearly see the face messed with tears and panic . 
she smiled , and brought the little girl home . she cleaned her up thoroughly and let her go without asking anything . 
she especially urged her before she left , " if you want to read books , you could come here , auntie 's home has a lot of books . " 
the little girl , who was still in a panic , gazed at her deeply before running away , and never showed up again . 
time passes as quickly as running water , and a period of ten years has passed in a flash without notice . 
she had forgotten the thing a long time ago , and still lives there with a calm and serene life . 
one afternoon , knocking noises came from outside the door . 
a young and strange girl with a pretty face appeared when she opened the door . she had a big smile on her face and was holding a big pile of gifts in her hands . 
" who are you looking for ? " 
she asked with doubt . 
the girl was moved and talked with a lot of words . 
it was not easy for her to find out from the strange girl 's talking that she was the little girl of that year . ten years after , she had graduated from a university without any difficulties , and now she had made a special trip to see her . 
the young girl said with a soft voice and tears in her eyes : " although i still don 't understand why you were willing to pretend to be my mom and save me , during these $number years , i have always felt that i want to call you mom . " 
the teacher 's eyes also started to become blurred . 
" if i did not help you that day , what was going to happen to you ? " she asked with curiosity . 
the face of the girl suddenly became gloomy . she shook her head slightly and said , " i cannot explain it clearly , i might have done a stupid thing or even killed myself . " 
the teacher felt a sudden jump in her heart , and began to rejoice in her mind . 
the decision she made at that moment in that year could even impact a person in her life . 
looking at the happy smile on the face of that girl , she also smiled with her . 
zhang xiwen 
the world is filled with lies and frauds in trash short - text messages flying everywhere . buddha said , " if i do not enter hell , who would enter hell , " 
anyone who does this , then , congratulate him , he can become a buddha sooner . 
any human being has a kind personality when he starts his life . 
everyone has a sympathetic heart . 
now social ethics is going down day by day , and human hearts are not what they were in those old days . 
maybe only selfless buddha can do something good . 
military situation observation : how long can iran hold up under air attacks by us armed forces ? 
yun feiquan 
if traditional warfare of attrition is described as letting an opponent bleed to death , then modern warfare is shooting at the head of an opponent $number and making him a " human vegetable " before he bleeds . 
the gap between the military capabilities of iran and the united states is not their quantities , but understanding of modern warfare . 
iran , which came to a draw with iraq in an eight - year war , does not seem to understand the real meaning of modern high - tech warfare . 
the british international intelligence comments pointed out a few days ago , after it analyzed the state of us armed forces movements , that the us armed forces are preparing to launch large - scale air attacks on iran ... 
the current status of the iranian air force is worrisome . 
the present status of the iranian air forces is quite similar with that of the iraqi air force before the iraq war $date . 
iran itself does not have the capacity to independently develop modern weapons , and is embargoed from importing weapons from the west . 
once a war breaks out , it is really a question of whether those old and obsolete aircrafts of the iranian air force could take off to confront the us armed forces . 
currently , the iranian air defense system is mainly composed of the air force and ground air defense troops of the iranian regular armed forces , and the air - defense forces of the revolutionary guard corps . 
among them , the iranian air forces have around $number troops , and $number various types of combat aircrafts . 
their primary aircraft models include the f-4 " phantom , " f-5 " tiger , " and f-14 " tomcat " made by the us and the mig-29 made by russia , etc. 
the ground air defense troops are mainly equipped with surface to air missiles , including the us " hawk , " british " javelin " and some of the russian " sam " series of missiles . 
harold hutchinson , a us military expert , and helamuchisin , a military expert from russia 's politics and military analysis institute , analyzed the current status of the iranian air defense forces , and think that the iranian air defense capacities and air defense system and construction still have some loopholes in the current status . 
hutchinson thinks that the iranian air forces are not at all at the same level with the us armed forces from the perspective of whole actual strength . 
a lot of the iranian combat aircrafts made by the us cannot be used because of lack of parts , upgrades , and maintenance . 
the f-14 fighter planes previously regarded as the elite ones in the iranian air force only have about ten capable of taking off from the ground . 
the combat reliability of aim $number " phoenix " missiles , claimed to be capable of over - the - horizon attacks , is also doubtful . 
helamuchisin pointed out that those iranian air defense missile systems provided by the us $date of the last century have lost their combat powers because of lack of spare parts . 
and other air defense weapons that do not form any systems , such as weapons obtained from russia and other countries , have no capabilities at all to cope with the us armed forces , which have powerful electromagnetic combat capabilities . 
scrappy weapons affect combat power 
apparently , the iranian government realizes that its fate in a war depends on whether it is capable of defending the sky over its head , and is starting to prepare only at the last moment , scrape weapons together , and strengthen its air defense system . 
its methods can be summed up as the two strategies from the current state : 
$number one is to conceal important nuclear facilities as much as possible and strengthen their anti - strike capabilities . 
according to a report from the british newspaper times , iran has hidden core parts of its nuclear facilities $number meters under ground and added a protection shell of $number - meter - thick cement , including the nuclear plant in natanz and the uranium enrichment center in isfahan . 
but the us armed forces have taken a strategy in advance . they saw the effects of underground bunkers in anti - air attack combat as early as during the gulf war $date , and have rushed developing various ground - penetrating bombs . 
through $number years ' studies on targets , the us armed forces have had a whole set of combat methods and weapons coping with underground consolidated bunkers . 
iran has also purchased a lot of advanced air defense weapons from russia in recent years . 
since the end of last year , the iranian government has reached agreements with russia , one after another , for the purchase of the pechora-2a air defense missile system and $number sets of " dower " air defense missile systems , worth $number us dollars . 
however , a modern war is a rivalry between systems . 
various us armed forces air - attack weapons are developed by the us itself , and they have been sharpened and become a set of war machines with outstanding effects after years of tests in actual warfare . 
and those " new weapons " scraped together by iran from other countries are still a question of whether they can form combat power in a short time . 
weapons are not iran 's only gap . 
combat outlines , published by the us armed forces $date , $number came up with the idea of " integrated air - ground warfare , " and stressed the use of air supremacy to strike high - value targets in an enemy 's strategic depth area , paralyzing the enemy 's command system at the beginning of a war , and making him as " meat on the cutting board " even though he has very powerful conventional forces . 
in the gulf war $date , kosovo war $date , and the iraq war $date , what the us armed forces paid attention to was not how many aircrafts the opponents had , but the firing range of their own " tomahawk " cruise missile . 
although the iranian government has prepared for possible air attacks and started to take measures to strengthen air defense capabilities , iran , which came to a draw with iraq in an eight - year war , does not seem to understand the real meaning of modern high - tech warfare . 
with the development of us armed forces military transition work in recent years , the air - attack activities of the us armed forces are totally different from the carpet bombing method in the vietnam war era , and rely on various new high - tech weapons and high - precision and whole - depth air strikes that are based on modern information technology . 
how long the iranian ground air defense system can sustain itself in this kind of air strikes is still an unknown element .

rivaling microsoft by uniting with google ; is dell collecting a " stocking fee ? " 
yun feiquan 
dell inc . ( us ; dell ) and google confirmed on tuesday that dell is testing personal computers loaded with google 's software packages . 
this move might pose a serious threat to the dominant status of microsoft corp. , msft , in the pc software market . 
jess blackburn , the news spokesman for dell corporation , said that the corporation is assessing google 's software . 
after the software is installed , pc users can use the software to search not only on the internet , but also for information stored on their pcs . 
blackburn confirmed that the software the corporation is testing includes the dell homepage supported by google , google 's desktop search system and google 's toolbar . 
google 's news spokesman , jon murchinson , also confirmed at the same time that his company is testing a batch of software , developed by google , with dell . 
as the wall street journal previously reported , google - the it new baron - is negotiating with dell and hewlett - packard co . , and is trying to persuade these computer manufacturing giants to install google 's software for their computers . 
according to an internal source cited by the wall street journal , to achieve the goal , google might pay $number dollars to dell in the coming three years . 
however , neither company has disclosed related details . 
and also , the hewlett - packard side has refused to make a comment on it . 
the microsoft corporation news spokesman , neil charney , refused to make a comment on the news mentioned above . 
microsoft is currently planning to promote its next - generation search tool for the windows operating system and strengthen development of its online business . 
on the day the news was released , google 's stock price fell another $number , dropping to $number dollars . 
the microsoft 's stock price fell $number , and closed at $number dollars on that day . 
some analysts pointed out that google is anxious to seek another direction of expansion in addition to network searches , and that its integration with dell and other pc giants might prompt google to threaten microsoft 's core business . 
matt rosoff , an analyst on microsoft 's direction at a market investigation and research company , said that microsoft is absolutely concerned and worried that google is eager to expand its new income sources . 
but some analysts do not think so . 
charles di bona , an analyst at market analysis company sanford c. bernstein , pointed out that it is too early for google to shake microsoft 's dominant status . 
reporter 's journal : google shakes microsoft 's domination ? 
hui zhengyi 
there is no doubt that computers have become necessities in the life and work of modern people . 
however , there is only a minority of people who understand the working rationale of computers , when everyone can skillfully operate them . 
like they use " dummy " cameras , most " newbies " can play the black boxes well as long as those boxes have friendly interfaces , and convenient and simple software . 
thus , original software installed on a pc manufacturer 's products can usually determine most consumers ' using habits . 
it is through this measure that microsoft has tightly controlled the pc operating system market . 
right now , google , a new rival of microsoft , tends to share part of the market through the same measure . 
a well - known economics medium in taiwan recently made a very interesting metaphor . 
" computer manufacturers including dell and hewlett - packard are starting to use computers like shelves in a supermarket and are collecting the " stocking fee " from software companies . 
a successful bidder can make its own software show up in the 'critical ten minutes ' when users turn on their new computers , and guide consumers to use its products . 
this kind of fee collection mode is like how a supermarket collects stocking fees from food manufacturers . 
this phenomenon demonstrates that microsoft 's control power is beginning to loosen without a doubt . 
managers at microsoft have warned bill gates that the microsoft 's hegemonic status will eventually be threatened if google starts to pay pc manufacturers for installation of google 's software on their computer products . 
no matter what the outcome is , the number one status that microsoft has been enjoying in those comfortable days may become history . 
after all , it is easy to become dominant , but it is difficult to maintain a dominant status . 
nothing is big in the eyes of quanda , and everything is a common one in the world .

just sword : prospects for $number 
& lt ; poster & gt ; hope 
just sword : prospects for $number 
author : just sword 
i remember that in the beginning of $number , apple journal in hong kong published an article titled " dharma wheel spins constantly and its merits can overcome an enemy country . " 
the article alleged that $number was a year in which falun gong advanced rapidly while singing triumphant songs . 
the article stated that overseas officials of the chinese communist party acted like buffoons suppressing falun gong in various places , and totally lost face when beginning falun gong learners told the truths everywhere in the world . 
but compared with the marvelous scene showing the great wave of party membership withdrawal brought by the " nine comments " $date , $number does not seem outstanding . 
then , how will $number be ? 
the two events that occurred at the beginning of this year can probably demonstrate some development track for this year . 
one is the article " elimination of evil " published by the founder of falun gong . this article announced and sentenced that those agents of the chinese communist party will face their coming judgment day after $date . 
maybe many people still have doubts about or disbelieve this article . 
but no matter whether they believe it or not , the history and facts will prove it ! 
of course , those agents of the chinese communist party (ccp) are like rats living in dark ditches . 
their " natural or accidental death " will not draw attention from the society and public opinion . 
but broad deaths or remorse of ccp agents at home and abroad brought by the heavens will definitely bring powerful strikes and shake the power strata of the ccp . 
they will have to carefully consider their path of retreat and road for life - withdrawal from the party , desertion or changing their side under the awesome deterrence of the elimination brought by the heavens . 
thus , the " superbly stable bureaucratic system and group of the ccp " will begin to be shaken , disrupted , and collapse ! 
the other event is the hunger strike campaign for human rights launched by gao zhicheng . 
this suddenly arisen campaign , which did not receive a good prediction from some people in the beginning , unexpectedly brought warm reactions from everywhere in the world , and common responses from all strata and various forces . 
if this activity can integrate various just forces and suffering masses into a connection and make it real and big , then the outside force that launches the final strike on the ccp , the evil regime that is as fragile as a pile of eggs , will finally be formed from it . 
if we say that $number was a year when the communist party was eliminated from the perspective of the spiritual aspect , then $number will be the phase in which the party will be gotten rid of in both the spiritual and material aspects . 
with the further spread of the " nine comments " and further development of the wave of party membership withdrawal , the self - disruption of the ccp , and the cohesion and formation of outside just forces , the life of the ccp monster will formally enter into a countdown state . 
the wills of the heavens and humans have been integrated , and the sacred power and human strength are gathering . 
the long sword in the sky is directly pointed at the ccp monster ! 
if we say that $number was a year for advancing rapidly while singing triumphant songs , and $number is a marvelous year , then what will be the conclusion of $number ? 
i hope it will be a shocking great change , and a victory and triumphant return !

xu zhiyong : a letter to li qun , the secretary of linyi city party committee 
& lt ; poster & gt ; fa buer 
sender : sunnypku ( sunny ) 
mail area : square 
title : xu zhiyong : a letter to li qun , the secretary of linyi city party committee : hooliganism will also harm yourself 
website for sending mail : feeling like old friends at $number meeting ( wed $date $time $number ) . this website ( yjrg.net ) 
until yesterday , the government of linyi , led by you , had illegally placed chen guangcheng under house arrest for $number days . 
you collaborated with rogues and the mafia society to put a blind legal citizen in jail illegally for a long time . 
you cut off his home 's phone line , installed a cell phone jamming device in his yard ; 
you also beat him and his family members many times . 
your barbarous conduct has gone beyond the bottom line of a civilized society . 
you also used means of rogues and the mafia society to beat me and lawyer li fangping in the beginning of $date . but we bore this , and we always tried to understand your difficult situation as much as possible , and were even acquiescent for a time of the house arrest of chen guangcheng . 
however , $number days have passed . you not only have not controlled your behavior , but you also make it worse . 
you sent a big team of policemen and rogues to harass villagers ; 
you continued to arrest and beat villagers ; 
what you have done is too outrageous ! 
today , i clearly remind you that those means of rogues and the mafia society will harm yourself in turn at the moment when you continue to organize rogues and the mafia society to besiege chen guangcheng . 
it was worth your examination when this thing started in the beginning . 
the family planning of linyi is $number one from the bottom of the provincial list in the whole province . 
the anxiety in your mind is understandable as the secretary of the city party committee . 
but it is wrong for you to think that only use of violence and force can implement the state 's law and policy because of the low qualities of the people in linyi . 
whose fault exactly is it that citizens do not coordinate with the conduct of the government ? 
is it because of the low qualities of the citizens or much less public trust , since the government has told too many lies and made too many schemes ? 
if (we) say that the same government 's conduct was not that absurd ten years ago , $date china 's society has made obvious progress and human rights protection has been written into the constitution ; don 't you think that your barbarous conduct is too outrageous ? 
why don 't you examine that only your linyi dares to act in this way ? 
why is only your linyi unable to practice law enforcement by using democratic and legal means ? 
linyi city should have been able to make a sincere explanation and make the public understand , after a batch of brave citizens including chen guangcheng reported about the fact of the barbarous law enforcement , a batch of citizens including teng biao - who dared to protect citizen 's rights - were involved , and the investigation conclusion was made by the national family planning committee . 
after all , family planning is a difficult topic with chinese characteristics . 
everyone can understand your difficulties . 
however , you took a further absurd measure - brought chen guangcheng back and put him in jail by catching him from beijing - and also tried to accuse him of illegally providing the state 's confidential information . 
don 't you think that it is a very absurd accusation for a blind man who lives in a poor mountain village ? 
in fact , as long as you have truly corrected mistakes , as long as you have done things very well , are you still afraid of the criticism of a blind man ? 
is it necessary for you to send several dozens of people to watch him $time a day , and even sentence him in a hurried and desperate way ? 
i and lawyer li fangping arrived in dongshigu village on $date . we demonstrated our very clear position and hoped to solve the conflicts . 
we made a suggestion that we could talk with your officials to learn your ideas and requests . 
we took the initiative and suggested that we could help you to persuade chen guangcheng , to influence him not to say some of his words . 
we hoped that you would not treat a blind man in this way , and both sides should make some compromises . 
however , your decision maker just follow his own way , and moreover , even had " carefully planned " an episode - to beat and put us in jail illegally . 
do you think that your activities can make us scared ? 
we have not done anything that violates laws . 
we are fearless . 
although china 's legal system is not perfect , at least it has not become absolutely lawless . 
you think that use of means of rogues and the mafia society can scare us away , then you have greatly underestimated our determination and willpower . 
as long as we would like to , we have many people who have many legitimate reasons to go to linyi or go to see chen guangcheng . 
you can beat lawyers and scholars one , two , and three times , but every time would attract broad attention and reports about it . 
do you really dare to beat us ten times ? 
don 't you care about your official position very much ? 
if somebody is beaten and injured , will your position still be in a solid status ? 
not listening to our reasonable advice , instead using some indecent means of rogues , don 't you think this is very silly and dangerous ? 
i want to tell you clearly that , in china , there is a big batch of excellent citizens who are loyal to conscience and follow the legal system . 
we do not fear rogues and the mafia society . 
we cannot stand reckless trampling on the bottom line of human civilization . 
if you have done too much beyond boundaries , we will calmly and confidently $date forward batch by batch toward your sticks until the moment when you retreat . 
you should be clear that use of the means of rogues and the mafia society is not something good for you . 
do not think that you can get rid of any link connected with those local rogues or hooligans who beat villagers as long as you hide backstage . 
finally , i also want to remind you to treat chen guangcheng well . 
a person who was blind from his childhood , graduated from a college of traditional chinese medicine , self - studied laws and english , and sued beijing subway company for the interest of the blind , and brought tap water for villagers , and became a well - known " lawyer chen " everywhere . 
you even mobilized shameful indecent individuals to make rumors about and slander him , and tried to accuse him of illegally sending confidential information across the border . don 't you think that what you did is too outrageous ? 
it is illegal for you to place chen guangcheng under house arrest , and it is also dangerous for you to do this . 
you should have been able to release him for sure . 
if the conduct of barbarous law enforcement has been stopped , how long could he maintain the criticism if you let him criticize it freely ? 
but today you are continuously smearing your own image . 
you won 't be peaceful as long as chen guangcheng has not been set for free for a day . 
it is enough for you to make him suffer . 
we would never stand by and do nothing if you still want to charge him with any crime or use further rogue means . 
citizen xu zhiyong , $date 
does the chinese nation deserve to have democracy ? 
& lt ; poster & gt ; exploration of the path of china 's peace and liberation , and promotion of the ideological liberation of our countrymen 
i admit very disappointedly that the chinese nation does not deserve to have democracy ! ! ! 
aren 't those who post their messages here doing this thing now ! 
the pity is that there are not many people who go online and read it ( compared with $number ) . 
those who go online and care and participate in these kinds of topics would be much fewer : i dare to allege that the number would be less than $number of people online . 
not to mention that this network has the golden shield project , which is the biggest , most thorough , advanced , expensive , and quality one . 
it is true . 
one could feel depressed , hopeless , helpless , and even think of surrendering , but if one wants to live a human life , whom can he depend on except that he himself struggles for it ? 
although doing a thing depends on human effort , and success relies on the heavens , i would think i am wrong if i have not made an effort for my own ideal , even though it is not successful , and i deserve to live like a dog . 
making an effort for a just thing itself can make one 's own life somewhat wonderful , and at least in his heart when he evaluates himself . 
in fact , i do not need to be concerned about china 's future at all , 
because the environment in the world is no longer allowing a regime that has not been elected to exist for long . 
this is just a matter of time . 
what i lament is that the chinese nation is very lucky to be led on the path to hell by a world - class great man and completely exploited from its bone and blood whenever it is at a historical turning point . even if somebody calls piles of white bones and areas of blood stains along the path as brilliances , and forces us to be proud of the brilliances . 
everywhere has a dark night , but the longest one is in shenzhou ( the sacred state ) . 
people would suffer a lot when the qin emperor integrated with the confucian sage . 
qin shihuang was an open tyranny and the confucian sage privately washed brains . 
it is not that chinese people do not deserve to have democracy ; it is because they have not had the democratic gene or their gene has been degenerated . 
a nation that has been established for $number years , it might have had democracy a long time ago if its national culture contained democratic elements . 
what were chinese people doing when athens established a democratic system , rome set up a republic , the british passed the constitution , the french published the declaration of human rights , and the americans issued the declaration of independence ? 
mongolians had a kurultai system for selection of their king before they entered into zhong yuan ; manchurians in their early time had a ministers council of the prince regent for democratic consultation . why were those systems all gone when they entered into the han region ? 
chinese people pursue materials only and have no interest in spiritual faith and political rights . 
if you do not believe it , as long as a chinese person has an election right , he can sell it to you for a meat pancake . 
$number years later , if chinese people want democracy , there must be an earthquake coming . if you can run , please do it !

dalai envoy holding closed - door meeting with chinese officials

dalai envoy holding closed - door meeting with chinese officials 
the dalai lama stressed that he hopes that tibet will have autonomy instead of independence . 
an envoy of the dalai lama , the tibetan spiritual leader in exile , is holding a closed - door meeting with chinese officials in beijing , and no details have been disclosed publicly . 
this is $number formal meeting since china and the dalai government in exile restored their contact $date . 
but as usual , neither side has disclosed any details when holding the closed - door meeting . 
a reporter said that both sides have held many talks , but have not made any substantial achievement so far . 
the dalai lama , who is in exile in north india , said that he hopes that tibet will have autonomy instead of independence . 
the chinese side refused to make any comment on the bilateral talks . 
but as analysts said , the reason why beijing hoped to have the bilateral talks is partially because it is worried that if the spiritual leader in exile dies , it might make tibetans unhappier about china 's rule . 
cultural identification 
the dalai government in exile delegation is led by lodi gyaltsen gyari , who was the chief delegate for several previous talks . 
a spokesman for the tibetan government in exile said that several talks held in switzerland between them and chinese officials $date were very " close and frank , " which brings hope to tibetans . 
the spokesman said that they hope to eventually solve related issues with the chinese leadership based on the foundation established by negotiations , and let the tibetans have freedom , and maintain the cultural identification that they think is the most important thing . 
cgp beili 
dalai lama envoy reiterated not to seek tibetan independence . 
the dalai lama will visit washington dc this month . 
before the dalai lama , the tibetan spiritual leader , visits the united states on $date , his envoy said that the tibetan government in exile does not request tibetan independence . 
lodi gyaltsen gyari said in washington that he hopes that the chinese government will ensure protection of the unique tibetan culture and tradition . 
it is expected that when the dalai lama visits the united states next week , he will discuss tibetan issues with president bush , and hope that bush could urge the chinese government to give tibet real autonomy . 
delegates of the dalai and officials from beijing had direct contact for $number time in bern in $date of this year . 
" a real autonomy " 
lodi gyaltsen gyari pointed out that both the tibetan government in exile and chinese authorities have seen some positive aspects from their talks in recent years . 
the dalai lama 's envoy discovered that leaders from beijing , especially those delegates of the central united front work department of the central committee of the chinese communist party , are more willing to listen to their views than they did before . 
however , lodi gyaltsen gyari said that there are too many differences between the tibetan government in exile and the chinese government , and there is a big gap between the positions of both sides . 
he said that in the past five years , the tibetan government in exile has done its best to create a good environment for negotiation requested by china , 
and china should also create a good environment for negotiation of the tibetan issue , and should not suppress the dalai lama all the time . 
he said that the dalai lama does not request tibetan independence , and tibet is still a part of china , but the chinese government must maintain the unique culture of tibet and " let tibetans have a real autonomy . " 
lodi gyaltsen gyari also pointed out that some chinese think that as soon as the dalai lama passes away , the tibetan issue will disappear . 
he said that this view is very dangerous , because once the dalai lama is gone , china would lose the historical opportunity to solve the tibetan issue . 
he said that as long as the chinese government responds to the request raised by the dalai lama , and comes up with a final solution , the dalai lama would not need to talk about the tibetan issue internationally any more . 
negotiation and compromise are the important means of democracy ! (zt) 
houze 
i just now saw a poster on " great decency - to old mr. guiren " sent by a network friend . 
his ( her ) original words are that " negotiation and compromise are the important means of democracy . otherwise , a split because of different views is a failure of democracy ! ! ! hope that those ideal democrats pay fully attention to this ! " 
this plain and tasteless sentence , which has not attracted interest from any network friends , has made me imagine a lot and have many sorts of feelings . 
at that moment i thought of the ancient times of china and the past of the west . 
i seldom sent the main poster . i cannot help but reply to the poster of the network friend in the way of the main poster . 
let 's see china 's ancient times . 
everyone knows that since qin shihuang established the universally unified and centralized power system in china , any subsequent dynasties were operated under the political framework . 
although the han dynasty temporarily implemented a " two - track system , " i.e. a political system that practiced the feudal system and centralized power system at the same time , it eventually switched to a complete centralized power system in the end . 
the outcome of this kind of centralized power system had an advanced aspect in the historical condition by then , which promoted the development of productivity . 
but we should also see that the long - term operation of the system for $number years had made local administrations lacking of their creativities , initiatives , and enthusiasms , and unable to make various suitable systems and policies for local developments based on local circumstances . 
the pyramid type of ruling system had made lower - class officials looking upward only and following directions from their superiors for everything . 
there was no room for coordination and negotiation because even local officials at the county level were appointed by the central government , not to mention those common people . 
when rights of farmers were infringed upon in ancient china , they could only bear it time and again . 
only when their basest rights were threatened , i.e. when a famine spread in big areas , a tyrannical rule or natural disaster caused loss of their living rights , would they rebel . 
in $number years , many peasant uprisings spread everywhere in the country like storms , but they never won a victory in a real sense except zhu yuanzhang , from chen sheng , and wu guang , who did not plan their uprising to the planned huang jin insurrection , from the huang chao revolt in the tang dynasty to the li zhicheng rebellion that established a dynasty for only a month . 
even the ming dynasty created by zhu yuanzhang was only a cycle of other dynasties , and there were no systematic changes . 
zhu yuanzhang , who came from a common family and did not receive much education , played the chinese ancient centralized power system to a sick extent , and to extremes . since then , the vigorous state of the type of the tang dynasty that was open , free , and tolerant , had become depressed . 
the atmosphere of freedom of speech disappeared in the vast land of china for a time . 
human nature was suppressed to the maximum extent . 
everybody became very cautious and dared not to say more words with reverence and awe . 
this was the only outcome of peasant uprisings in $number years , and it made chinese people neither humans nor ghosts . 
let 's see the medieval ages of the so - called dark time in western europe . 
the medieval ages of western europe were formed after the western rome was destroyed by nomadic nations , and lasted for $number years . they had nothing to do with the ancient greece and rome of the past . 
those ages featured the feudal system , i.e. land holding . 
many layers of land feudal lords , from the top to the bottom , had more autonomy . 
no matter whether small feudal lords who had an area of several square kilometers , or nobles who had titles of duke , marquis , count , viscount , and baron , since superiors and inferiors , and the left and right , could balance , restrain , and were interdependent with each other , and had their prerequisites and capabilities to strive for their own rights against kings , the scenes in which nobles sat with a king negotiating for their own interest emerged , which never happened in china 's 
compromises and concessions were made mutually instead use of violent means to knock down or replace opponents . 
in this way , through making various contracts , rights were continuously transferred to nobles and common people , and they had more and more rights , and kings had fewer and fewer . 
later , the british queen had only a status for display , and not any substantial power . 
democracy was gradually realized in this way ! 
let 's come back again to compare with ancient china , where every power was concentrated in the hands of emperors ( except li shimin ) , and there were almost no nobles . it was very difficult for peasants to be able to sit in front of a negotiation table , joyfully making compromises and concessions on a contract agreed to by both sides while enjoying a cup of tea or a glass of wine . 
under this circumstance , when the living right was taken away , only violent means could overthrow an existing dynasty and try to replace it . 
its outcome was the repeated cycle from the peak of the tang dynasty to the sick status of the ming dynasty . 
comparing histories between china and the west , we discovered that the contradictions between rulers and the ruled in ancient china were much more intensified than those in ancient western countries . 
no western countries had so many continuous peasant uprisings as ancient china had . 
in the western countries , when differences between ancient royal families and peasants emerged , what nobles and common people thought of $number was to settle them through a negotiation path , to obtain more rights gradually by making mutual concessions , and they seldom used violent means . 
understanding this , when we enter into $date , we can still see those democratic warriors in networks who have inherited the ideology of the absolute power concentration system of the ming dynasty , 
and have been poisoned by the virus of the cultural revolution that they can say nothing except those words of " down with or overthrow something . " 
and those concepts are the biggest barrier to democracy , because those people do not understand that negotiation , coordination , and compromise are the most important means and path for realization of democracy . 
cao xiaoming : who is going to " pay the bill " for enriching cultural activities in rural areas 
hou ze 
the author was lucky to spend this year 's spring festival in a rural area of the mainland , and visited some relatives and friends . 
i was not only influenced by the dense atmosphere of the festival in the chinese rural area , but also concerned about those boring cultural activities there . 
the author discovered in a village where my relatives lived that this village organized villagers spontaneously to play a drama called " trotting horse lamp " for every spring festival in the past . 
the drama is based on figures in the story of the three kingdoms . any adult or child could play a role in the drama , and villagers were not bored at all to watch it $number times . 
there were several of this kind of performance teams of " trotting horse lamp " in the whole township . they performed not only in their own villages , but also went to other villages for visits , and exchanged frequently . 
but this village did not organize the performance this year . 
the reason is that just the costumes for " trotting horse lamp " would cost a lot , which were bought in the past through donations from villagers . now they are too worn out to be taken on . 
nobody was willing to donate any more , if asking villagers for donations household by household . other villages in the township had a similar situation . 
the village suddenly became quiet without the " trotting horse lamp . " 
adults started to play mahjong . 
children also began to play cards . 
villagers said that this festival had no fun . 
the big scene in the countryside is either shooting off fireworks or playing mahjong during the festival . 
the gambling trend cannot be stopped even though it is prohibited time and again , and is spread even further . gambling for up to $number yuan has become a routine game . especially , big batches of those migrant farmer workers who come back to their hometowns from other areas have played major roles in gambling sites . 
their hard - earned money from working in other areas for a year is lost in this way . 
family disputes occurred time and again because of gambling , which sometimes causes tragedies with families broken up and decimated . 
some farmers said that they gambled not only during festivals but also participated in gambling frequently in slack seasons . 
nowhere to go if they did not gamble . 
it is too difficult to organize cultural activities and look for " fun " in the countryside . 
not only are there no facilities and funding , but also nobody organizes them . 
but in this aspect , the practice in jiangxi is definitely good news for farmers . 
to enrich the cultural life of the farmer masses , the government of jiangxi province not only implemented the policy that " the government provides funding for it ; the market operates it ; townships build stages ; and farmers watch dramas " last $date , 
but they also arranged at least $number yuan every year for the special fund for rural cultural causes and delivered good - quality cultural products to the rural masses . 
in the beginning of this new year , it added an additional $number yuan , a total of $number yuan , for the establishment of special funding for the rural cultural cause . 
and also , what this special funding " paid " toward the farmers ' " bill " is quite a good deal : 
various professional performance organizations are invited to have shows in rural areas , and provide at least four shows for every town each year . 
movie companies at every level are invited to organize film projection teams to show movies in the countryside , and at least six feature or scientific education movies should be shown for every administrative village each year ; 
cultural activities with local features participated in by the masses are organized and developed at least two to three times for every township each year . 
it is not difficult for us to see from the " purchase list " that the government does not simply pay the bill , but thinks hard how to use the limited funds in the critical area and deliver a cultural banquet that exceeds its money value to the farmer masses , and has done a big substantial thing for them . 
now , a lot of farmers are very happy and joyful for immunity from providing " royal grains and state 's tax . " 
if every government can pay the " bill " for enriching cultural activities of the farmer masses as jiangxi did , it would be another happy thing falling from the sky for farmers . 
and this " happy thing " can not only liberate farmers from the mahjong table , and make them " active " in cultural activities , but also add bricks and tiles for the construction of the new socialist countryside . 
it was a false alarm that a child of wang peirong was almost hijacked 
peirongwangsohu@gmail.com 
it was a false alarm that a child of wang peirong was almost hijacked 
the child of wang peirong recounted it completely at a little bit after $number p.m. on the evening of $date : 
the child of wang peirong was called off by a gate guard when she was making up missed physics lessons at $number middle school of xuzhou on the morning of $date . 
the guard said to wang peirong 's child that three unidentified men had told the gate guard at $number middle school that wang tianjiao , the child of wang peirong , had not gone back home for three days because of discord between her parents . 
now her mother was missing , and they were leaders from her mother 's work unit , and wanted to enter $number middle school and take away wang peirong 's child . 
wang peirong 's child said : what the three men said was totally untrue . she refused to go with the three men . 
wang peirong 's child was not taken away with the help of the gate guard of $number middle school . 
wang peirong 's child called one of her mother 's leaders at noontime to confirm it . the leader denied that he had sent his men to visit $number middle school . 
wang peirong 's child obtained a phone number of one of her father 's leaders from her . 
wang peirong 's child called her father 's leader . 
wang peirong 's child said : three men visited $number middle school and wanted to take me away . 
the leader asked : why didn 't you go with them ? 
wang peirong 's child said : i would be dead for sure if i went with them . 
wang peirong 's child hung up the phone right away after she finished her words . 
wang peirong felt that the case was serious after she listened to her child 's description , and reported it to the police . 
the feedback from a public security station on $date was that wang peirong 's child 's description was basically true . 
the public security station asked the security unit of kuangda if it had sent those men to look for wang peirong 's child ; the response was no . 
the station asked the security unit again , and other units under kuangda , if they had sent those men to look for wang peirong 's child ; their responses also were no . 
some related department passed on a message to wang peirong and her family members through another person , and asked them to pay attention to their security . 
leaders of some related department in xuzhou city had paid close attention to the incident after it occurred . 
the possibility of hijacking the child was excluded through an investigation done by the criminal detection unit of the public security bureau of xuzhou city . 
wang peirong thanked leaders of related departments in xuzhou city and the criminal detection unit of the public security bureau of xuzhou city . 
this was a false alarm that was probably mainly caused by the gate guard at $number middle school . 
now the criminal detection unit of the public security bureau of xuzhou city finds out that , on $date , three men , including leaders of the work unit of the physics institute where wang peirong works , called wang peirong , but could not find her ( wang peirong still does not know what for so far ) . they tried to find wang peirong in a hurry and wanted to look for a teacher of wang peirong 's child to ask if wang peirong 's child was still in xuzhou or not . 
heavy talking topic : why corruption has a lower risk but anti - corruption has a higher cost 
http://bbs.people.com.cn/bbs/readfile?whichfile=44796&amp;typeid=39 
what a corrupted official cares about is those several related officials who are his superiors in the current cadre and anti - corruption mechanisms , not the masses of people . 
thus , once he feels that he has successfully deceived or tamed those several officials who can determine his fate , he would boldly do whatever he likes to conduct his great cause for accumulation of wealth through corruption , and could ignore the feelings of the masses of people that are only a few feet away from them . 
on the contrary , if common people who do not have power in their hands take the initiative to oppose corruption , they might bring extremely brutal strikes and retaliation upon themselves , 
or be imposed with political accusations , and end up with failure before achieving any victory . 
compared with the two sides , corrupted individuals have lower risk , but individuals who oppose corruption have to bear a higher cost .

public anxiety as bird flu footprint expands across europe , nigeria 
brussels , the $number (afp) 
the unrelenting advance of bird flu across europe is causing anxiety among the public . 
the european commission (ec) approved the establishment of " buffer zones " which would cover entire areas of infected countries and in which trade and transport of poultry products would be prohibited . 
in africa , where the lethal h5n1 strain of the virus was discovered eight days ago in nigeria , the disease has continued spread to more poultry farms and showed signs of having crossed the northern border into niger . 
egyptian officials are also investigating the sudden unexplained death of a batch of chickens in a poultry farm , raising concerns that the virus may continue to spread . 
the virus has influenced europe 's poultry markets , where sales have plummeted . the european commission reiterated that there was no need for panic . 
eu health and food commissioner , kyprianou , said , " it is understandable that the public is concerned , but they need not be unduly alarmed . " 
following provisions for three - kilometer protection zones and ten - kilometer surveillance zones around virus outbreak points , the european commission also issued a regulation that will turn entire regions where the virus is found into " buffer zones " .

we now turn our attention once again to the iranian nuclear issue . 
the international atomic energy agency (iaea) confirmed on the $number that the iranian government had sent a letter to the iaea requiring the removal before the middle of the month of all devices monitoring iranian nuclear facilities .

addressing the current tension over the iranian nuclear issue , russian foreign minister lavrov said in athens , greece that that russian - iranian cooperation was ongoing . 
and that it would become the motive force for a solution to the iranian nuclear issue .

chinese ministry of foreign affairs spokesman kong quan said on the $number that although the iaea reported the iranian nuclear issue to the un security council , the organization 's responsibility for settling the issue has not been passed on to the security council . 
therefore , the parties concerned should still try to break the deadlock over the issue within the framework of iaea . 
under an iaea resolution , iaea director general el baradei will deliver a report on the iranian nuclear issue to the security council in $date . 
the security council will make a final decision after evaluating the report . 
we believe that such a resolution , it talks about requiring the iranians ... well ... being able to implement the relevant resolutions of the security council and honor their commitments . besides , it does not deliver the issue or pass it on to the security council . 
recently , china has been seeking a plan for the peaceful resolution of the iranian nuclear issue through diplomatic channels . 
kong quan said that on $date , zhang yan , director of the department of armament control for china 's ministry of foreign affairs , met in tehran with ali larijani , secretary of iran 's supreme national security council and iran 's chief nuclear negotiator , for talks on the iranian nuclear issue . 
china hopes that iran should take full note of the concern of the international community and create conditions for the peaceful solution of the iranian nuclear issue . 
a solution for the iranian nuclear issue within iaea framework is not only in the interest of china . we firmly believe that it is also in the interest of all parties . 
therefore , we again appeal to the concerned parties in the international community not to abandon diplomatic efforts in respect to the issue . 
hamas , which is in the process of organizing a new palestine autonomous government , officially announced that , with the exception of choice for prime minister , the list of cabinet members in the new government is essentially in order .

uh , in responding to questions from this station 's reporters regarding the incident , the police chief said that the % pw , the terrorist group is actually an extremely loose network that does not have an intact organization . 
and , eh , a lot of people become members of the group just by calling themselves members . 
uh , so , as far as the pakistani authorities are concerned , they , uh , are still focusing the investigation on several actual individuals . 
as for the group , uh , they are not regarding it as an especially key aspect . 
okay . 
okay , tao ye . 
( ( ) )

at $time on the $number at the residence of the danish prime minister , prime minister rasmussen and the ministry of foreign affairs convened a news conference . 
rasmussen said . 
the incident , which has led to violent incidents at some european embassies , is not a matter between muslim countries and denmark alone . 
receiving widespread international support in this difficult situation has been very important to the government and people of denmark . 
we have formed an alliance with france . 
various organizations of other european countries and the us in moslem countries are now working together closely . 
just a few minutes earlier , us president bush had telephoned . 
during the telephone call , he expressed support and solidarity with denmark . 
rasmussen said : we still believe that dialogue and tolerance , not violence , are the means to resolve this incident . 
we emphasize that freedom , democracy and respect for faiths are precious values . 
today , we urge the people of all moslem countries to work together to quell the spread of this violent situation . 
we need to resolve this issue through dialogue , not violence . 
we are today facing a growing international situation . 
we are seeing danish flags being burned and danish embassies being wrecked . 
we are seeing the danish being viewed as an intolerant people and as enemies of islam . 
this is false . 
extremists and radicals are using a contradiction between cultures to escalate the situation . 
rasmussen emphasized : denmark and the danish people are not enemies of islam or any other religion . 
for generations , danes have transcended politics in their fight for human rights , democracy and freedom . 
we continue to carry out that struggle . 
it is a part of denmark 's history and a fundamental part of our society today . 
denmark is one of the world 's most tolerant and open societies . 
we respect all religions . 
we prohibit violence . 
we believe in equal rights for all people . 
reported by ntdtv reporter li luo and danny in copenhagen , denmark . 
iranian extremists angry at the publication of cartoons of mohammed once again attacked the danish embassy in tehran on tuesday and threw molotov cocktails . 
at the same time , an iranian state - run paper sought revenge by organizing a contest for cartoons depicting nazis slaughtering jews . 
the us denounced the initiative as an arrogant attempt to take advantage of the situation to extend the consistent anti - israeli stance of iranian president ahmadinejad . 
roughly $number protestors climbed an enclosure to enter the compound of the danish embassy in iran . 
a crowd of roughly $number outside also threw rocks and molotov cocktails at the building .

the cartoons that gave rise to the controversy were $number published in the danish newspaper jyllands - posten last $date . 
newspapers in other european countries and three arab papers also carried the images . 
seeking revenge , iran 's best - selling newspaper , the hamshahri daily , announced recently that it would hold a contest for cartoons depicting nazi germany 's slaughter of jews . 
this move was denounced by the us and other countries . 
us state department spokesperson mccormack said he said that the initiative by iran 's largest - selling paper hamshahri as an extension of the virulent anti - israeli rhetoric of iranian president ahmadinejad . 
mccormack reiterated us support for freedom of speech throughout the world , including in iran . 
but he saw no comparison between hamshahri 's contest and the cartoons of mohammed published in the danish media . 
mccormack said : i don 't think anybody would draw any equivalences between freedom of the press in iran and freedom of the press in western europe and the us . 
ahmadinejad has said that the holocaust was a myth and called for israel to be wiped of the map . this drew widespread criticism from the us and other countries . 
mccormack said : hamshahri is funded and printed by tehran 's conservative municipal government . 
the holding of a cartoon contest on this occasion is in no way a coincidence .

the common people that experience the painful loss of their homes because they were coerced into demolishing them suddenly don 't have any income to rely on . 
there isn 't enough money for children 's tuition , so they don 't dare go to school . 
for several years now , the vast majority of people who appeal to higher authorities have been repaid with years of reeducation through labor . 
statistics show that shanghai is the region in china with the greatest number of appeals to higher authorities . 
han zhongming originally had a store , but he was forced to tear it down . his home was also resold at a profit .

he protested by threatening to leap off a building , cut his wrists and other methods until in recent days he was finally released .

government - hired thugs hauled the three members of her family out of the house and used a forklift to completely demolish the house along with the furniture .

besides resistance against the government 's ruffian tactics , chen enjuan spoke about her support for the hunger strike campaign , . 
attorney gao gave us a lot of legal help , help that was given very selflessly . 
the human right we are now demanding is democracy , because we are also thinking about the next generation . 
we of the last generation have already suffered enough , so we are fighting in order that the next generation will not undergo persecution . therefore , we need to participate in the human rights campaign and we cannot give up .

immediately following the decision by the international atomic energy agency (iaea) to refer the iranian nuclear issue to the un security council , iran has reiterated that ... eh ... there is no room for negotiations with the us , one of the promoters of the decision . 
well ... an iranian government spokesman said on monday that the policy iran has maintained to date in regards to relations with the us is not to engage in discussion or negotiation . 
he said the west has committed a grave error in referring the nuclear issue to the security council in an obvious attempt to block the development of iran . 
iran said on monday that ... eh ... it would discontinue cooperation with iaea , resume the extraction of enriched uranium and prohibit spot checks of its nuclear facilities . 
so , on this issue , iran 's current attitude is pretty hard - line , ut the attitude of the united states is even more hard - line . 
eh ... us defense secretary rumsfeld has repeatedly said that ... eh ... the use of force would not be ruled out in regard to this issue . 
well ... now there are rumors that the us military is putting such a plan into effect . 
they are developing a super bomb , called the " mother of all bombs " . 
eh ... once the department of defense gives the go - ahead , this super bomb will be used to blast iran . 
so , how big exactly is this mother of all bombs ? 
it has been said that , in terms of weight alone , the bomb weighs $number pounds , equal to the weight of a double - deck bus . also , its bulk is massive . 
such a super bomb has been developed mainly to bombard certain underground facilities of iran . 
because of its massive penetrating power , it can penetrate concrete and also steel plate . it can roughly create a pit that is half a mile in radius and $number deep , destroying several underground buildings and facilities . 
so it now seems that in this respect the us has really begun to hone its sword or make the bomb . 
rumsfeld ... eh ... said that , on this issue ... no means would be excluded as a solution to the iranian nuclear issue and a resort to force had been put on the table . 
elsewhere , irrespective of the continuous escalation of the iranian nuclear issue , an iranian official in china said in an interview with this station that iran actually would still work with the international community by persisting in peaceful negotiation ... eh ... in the hope of easing the crisis . 
but he also added that iran would adjust the details of cooperation with russia on a nuclear project . 
as for $number round of negotiations with russia regarding the enriched uranium cooperation project scheduled for $date , the iranians said that the negotiations would go on as planned , though it was emphasized that the changes that have taken place so far will make it necessary to adjust the content of the negotiations . 
russia has previously been a steady supporter of iran 's peaceful utilization of nuclear energy and had said that it would remain stick to its position that the iranian nuclear issue should not be referred to the security council . 
but , as we can see now , they have agreed to referring the iranian nuclear issue to the un security council . 
given this new development , as a result we may make some changes to the policy we agreed on with russia . 
before the un security council ultimately decides in $date whether to impose economic and political sanctions , iran will advocate continuous negotiations with related international organizations and , in the meantime , remains willing to cooperate with the international community to ease the current crisis . 
we stress the point that , for purpose of its own economic growth and national construction , iran will not abandon the right to the peaceful use of nuclear energy . 
iran has not violated any related international laws . we hope that the united states too will understand this . 
the iranian nuclear issue is completely different from the afghanistan and iraqi issues . 
i think the us is pretty clear about that itself . 
as for the so - called military strike , we haven 't seen any clear - cut expression of attitude on the part of the united states . 
we don 't want to see the further escalation of the crisis . 
although we also make a point of using peaceful negotiation , we will not bow to pressure . 
additionally , ( ( a ge bi ) ) also said that he hoped china would continue on the basis of its existing standpoint to cooperate with iran . 
this is hu lin ( ( of phoenix tv ) ) reporting from beijing . 
let 's $number take a look at today 's headlines .

residents of new york city woke up sunday morning to find themselves in a world of white . 
outdoors , most buildings and streets were covered with a thick coat of snow . 
new york 's central park recorded $number cm of snowfall . 
this is $number largest snowfall on record in the history of new york city . 
new york 's mayor bloomberg said : this was a frightening snowstorm . 
out of safety considerations , he urged people to stay in their homes and not to go outside . 
most flights from new york city 's three airports have to be cancelled . 
some of them won 't be resumed until monday . 
the capital washington is also experiencing a snowstorm , with snowfall having exceeded $number cm . 
grass and trees have all been draped in white attire . 
but president bush still attended a church service as usual . 
many of the city 's resident have also stepped outside their homes in order to take in the beautiful winter scenery and profit from chance to play in the snow . 
the national weather service 's radars show snowfall stretching from eastern virginia through to maine . 
in new jersey , new york 's long island , connecticut and maryland , power to homes and businesses was also cut following the snowstorm . 
it is estimated that more than one - $number $number users are without power . 
large areas of europe are also under the influence of a snowstorm . 
the state of bavaria in southern germany has mobilized $number firefighters and soldiers to work with police and volunteers in clearing snowfall from rooftops and roads . 
the deggendorf region in eastern bavaria is still under a state of emergency after several days of heavy snow . 
some small villages have lost contact with the outside world . 
a roof collapsed under heavy snow in bad reichenhall in the state of bavaria last month , killing fifteen people . 
this is a news brief by phoenix satellite television . 
new york was of course among the cities affected in the northeast region of the us that was hit by the blizzard . 
for the local situation , we will immediately connect with this station 's reporter in new york , luo xiaoying . 
hello , xiaoying . 
hello , xiaonan . 
hi . 
you 've just been hit with so much snow , so what is the situation actually like there ? 
i hear that power has even been cut to some areas . 
what areas have been affected ? 
yes , that 's right . 
in fact , the ... the area covered by the blizzard is extremely large . 
i 'm really happy to tell you that now we have finally seen the end of the blizzard . 
although the , the snowstorm was very violent , it didn 't cause any serious injuries or fatalities . 
many states in the area hit in the eastern us were affected : maryland received $number of snowfall ; pennsylvania got $number ; and the new york - new jersey area was at more than $number . 
snowflakes could be seen from virginia to maine , and even in tennessee . 
so , uh , as you just said , the , it resulted in power outages in many locations in the washington region and baltimore . 
the total ... total number of households affected by the power outage is approximately $number or so . 
new york is okay . the power outage , uh , power supply in the manhattan area of new york city is normal . there are just some power outages in the long island area . 
rhode island has declared a state of emergency . 
only snowplows and rescue vehicles such as ambulances are able to circulate on the roads . 
as for traffic and transportation , relatively early on the new york , uh , area 's three large airports were closed . 
but , uh , we learned toward the evening that there appeared to be some movement toward resuming activities at newark airport in new jersey and laguardia airport in new york . 
so there are some people who estimate that in a few hours from now those airports will open . 
delta airlines , for example , has announced that all flights to places like washington , philadelphia , boston , baltimore and the state of connecticut have been grounded until monday . 
reagan airport in washington dc has already been opened . 
buses in the new york - new jersey area are currently not running . 
trains are also operating at reduced frequency . 
it , uh , it is now sunday in new york . it is also the lantern festival . 
and as for we chinese , normally on the lantern festival some local chinese communities have lantern festival activities , but these have all had to be cancelled . 
likewise , most of the activities that the people of new york normally take part in on sunday have for the most part been cancelled . and , uh , no one is going outside , that is , they are all staying in their homes . 
um . 
what is giving everybody a headache now is how to get to work on monday . 
the snow removal , or rather the accumulated snow could cause some flooding . 
so the , uh , governments of the areas in the us being affected are now studying how to cope with the rush of people heading to work on monday , as well as the rush of automobiles . 
xiaonan . 
okay . 
thank you xiaoying for this latest report issued from the us . 
since there is nothing to be done , you might as well take a while to peacefully enjoy the beautiful snowscape . 
now let 's look at some news items about japan . 
koizumi has been contemplating upgrading the japan defense agency to a ministry so as to build up japan 's military muscle . 
but , heated debates erupted during the process , which ran into one obstacle after another . 
recently , a scandal surfaced involving tenders for engineering projects offered by the defense facilities administration agency , an institution under the defense agency . as a result , some former and current officials have been arrested by the authorities . 
therefore , many people advised koizumi to be careful in his move to upgrade the agency to a ministry . 
and recently , koizumi said that he had temporarily put the plan on the shelf rather then refer it to the parliament for review . 
and he also hopes that the two parties in power can discuss the issue carefully and , eh , continue their consultations . 
elsewhere , here is some other news . if you go to japan , there is now a new rule . 
that is , japan plans to , stipulates that most of tourists arriving in japan must have their fingerprints and photos taken . 
the move aims to prevent some unsafe individuals from entering japan 's borders and also prevent illegal immigration . 
er , so , it will probably be more troublesome going to japan now . 
of course , recently there was one good news in japan . 
that is , princess kiko , wife of $number son of japanese emperor , is pregnant . 
this development has caused many japanese to hope that she will give birth to a boy who will be heir to the throne . 
but , she also threw the imperial family , which has always stayed relatively quiet , into a commotion . 
uh , in fact , kiko is now of course a mature pregnant mother and she has all along been thought to be content with a family of four . 
being pregnant again at such an age , many people cannot help conjecturing that , uh , a fraternal scramble for the throne may arise in the imperial household . 
of course , many people are taking delight in talking about this conspiracy theory . 
to explain this , one must go back to a few years ago . 
eh , it 's like this . at that time , $date , because the wife of crown prince naruhito , contracted depression , the imperial household did not place too much hope on them at the time and instead turned to $number prince , fumihito , whom they put pressure on . 
at the time , fumihito did not do much in response . 
but , $date , the contradiction intensified somewhat after naruhito , uh , out of his care for his wife , reproached the imperial family on public occasions . 
it is said that the imperial family were furious and asked his peer , prince fumihito to stand out and rebut his elder brother , accusing him of showing disrespect for the imperial family and doting upon his wife . 
the brothers have been in discord from then on . 
now , if prince fumihito gives birth to a boy , the dominant role they play will become a pillar of the imperial household 
and the east palace , i.e. the crown prince will surely fall out of favor . 
eh , this is why many people say that , if things go on like this , the impact on the imperial household and the japanese society will be tremendous . 
united nations secretary general annan visited the white house on monday to meet with us president bush . 
in response to iran 's announcement that it was postponing nuclear talks with russia , annan urged iran to halt nuclear activity as quickly as possible and to resolve the issue through negotiations and not confrontation . 
elsewhere , news sources have reported that the us department of defense has actually already begun in earnest to devise plans for bombing iran as a last resort in case diplomatic efforts fail . 
originally , outside sources believed that bush and annan would discuss the possibility of the un security council imposing sanctions on iran , but the two did not make any announcement in that regard following the meeting . 
bush and annan both reiterated that they hoped to resolve the iran nuclear issue through negotiation . 
annan expressed concern over iran 's initiation of uranium enrichment activities and its decision to postpone nuclear talks with russia . 
the same day , us media reported , that pentagon military strategists had begun seriously planning for military action against iran so that if diplomatic efforts fails the us will use military methods to prevent iran from developing nuclear weapons . 
reports say that the us central command has started pinpointing attack targets . 
the attack could possibly be by submarine - launched ballistic missile or b2 bombers . 
on monday , annan urged all sides not to take actions that will intensify the crisis . 
according to the analysis of some military experts , iran could be capable of manufacturing a nuclear weapon within two years . 
furthermore , more than two years remain in bush 's $number term . 
he will endeavor to resolve the iran nuclear issue before the end of his term , regardless of whether peaceful or military methods are used . 
this is reported from washington by mou naiqian of phoenix satellite tv . 
on the $number , iranian president ahmadinejad said that large superpower states that use their nuclear weapons to threaten other countries will disappear . 
ahmadinejad was meeting with the diplomatic envoys of various countries to tehran on the occasion of the commemoration of the $number anniversary of the victory of the islamic revolution . 
he said the arms race between countries and the fight to achieve hegemony will not bear fruit . 
the hunger of the large superpowers will never be satisfied and they even go as far as to use nuclear weapons to threaten other countries . 
but he said that the large superpower countries that rely on nuclear weapons to threaten other countries will disappear . 
the day when mankind will have lasting peace and stability is close at hand . 
so it can be seen that now , not only the war of words , but in actual truth , the sabre - rattling between iran and the west and between iran and the us has become more intense the longer it has gone on . 
and because of the uncompromising attitude between iran and the us , recently there have been certain changes in the situation . that is , iran officially announced the day before yesterday that it would resume its plan to extract enriched uranium . 
in fact , some western diplomats speculate that iran had actually already resumed certain processes in the extraction of enriched uranium prior to this . 
in addition , iran also announced that it was postponing talks with russia for an indeterminate period of time . the talks were to deal with russia taking over the extraction of enriched uranium . 
of course , the postponement for an unlimited duration of the plan to hold talks was also brought about by the new situation that currently exists . 
and recently , because the us has continued to threaten that it will attack iran , the oxford research institute , a british think tank , issued a report . 
if the us actually employs military force , it will result in half the people being killed and furthermore would certainly spark a protracted wave of violence in the middle east . 
also , terrorist attacks would also grow in intensity . 
the price of oil would without doubt also surge in what would be one part of a domino effect . 
moreover , the report also says that if the us fails to subdue iran , it will result in iran resolving to move faster toward manufacturing its own nuclear weapons . 
we just spoke about the issue of talks between russia and iran . 
in fact , a spokesman for the iranian government said on monday that because the situation had changed , iran would postpone talks with russian officials originally scheduled on the $number regarding the extraction of enriched uranium inside russia 's border . 
a spokesman for the russian ministry of foreign affairs said : no official notice has yet been received from iran . 
it is therefore too early to say if the meeting will be postponed . 
furthermore , russia 's federal atomic energy agency and the commissioner of energy resources [ gu jinuofu ] said on monday : russian has prepared for talks with iran on the nuclear issue and the conditions and principles for negotiation . 
at the same time , recently the united states ' new york times published an editorial . 
the title of the editorial was also very attention - grabbing . it was called japan 's offensive foreign minister . 
the editorial highlighted the fact that japan 's foreign minister , taro aso , has recently issued a string of shocking statements . 
the statements were all extremely disingenuous and also extremely unwise , and they provoked widespread resentment in asian countries . 
the editorial likewise made special note of the fact that the japanese should acknowledge their errors and learn their lesson , rather than , as is currently the case , avoiding mention in post - war educational material of the things they did during the war . 
at the same time , the editorial also says that many of the opinions aired by taro aso , such as demanding that the prime minister pay homage at the yasukuni shrine and saying that colonial rule improved taiwan 's , uh , that japanese colonial rule improved taiwan 's educational standards , and so on , that he would make such statements shocked people , and , well , it is clear that he is bereft of any knowledge of history and that his diplomatic skills are also extremely poor . 
the new york times had $number largest circulation in the us last year . it can therefore be considered influential in us society . 
so this editorial should also have quite an effect . 
at the same time , some former senior officials in the us government as well as some specialists in asian issues have started a special discussion forum , that is , a discussion forum on sino - japanese relations . 
in the discussion forum , some specialist put forth the following viewpoint . 
they said sino - japanese relations were currently in a very tense period and that there was a potential danger of armed conflict . 
moreover , they said that the possibility of armed conflict breaking out between china and japan was currently even greater than that of armed conflict over the taiwan strait . 
uh , and once armed conflict breaks out , the us will definitely be dragged into it because the us is certain to become involved . 
a spokesman from japan 's ministry of foreign affairs who also participated in the forum said that sino - japanese relations were in truth at a very tense stage currently . 
any mistake could lead to serious consequences . 
elsewhere , the georgian parliamentary committee on defense and security held a general meeting and decided to eject the russian peacekeeping troops that are in the south ossetia region . 
russia 's parliament will hold a general assembly today in order to deliberate the proposal . 
uh , specialists say that if the proposal to expel russian peacekeepers is approved , it could lead to a complete breakdown in relations between georgia and russia . 
a spokesman for the russian peacekeeping force said on the $number that two military food - transport vehicles belonging to the russian peacekeeping force were blocked by georgian police and the driver was expelled . 
uh , the spokesman demanded that georgia immediately halt such provocative activities , otherwise russia would not bear responsibility for the consequences stemming from the incident . 
the two military vehicles transporting grain and non - staple foods and belonging to the logistical system of the russian peacekeeping forces were inspected on monday night by georgian police in the south ossetia region of georgia . 
the on - duty georgian police expelled the russian driver and the detained personnel and forcibly removed the two military vehicles . 
the incident has angered the russian peacekeeping force . 
a spokesman for the russian peacekeeping force said that on $date the georgian police confiscated a military vehicle in the region on the basis of a traffic accident . the truck has not yet been returned . 
on $date , it again used a visa problem as a reason to detain three russian officers for two full days . 
georgia 's arbitrary acts of provocation aim to cause a bloody incident in the region and force the russian soldiers to fire their weapons , so that the peacekeeping force will withdraw from south ossetia . 
the same day , russia 's ambassador to georgia issued an urgent petition to the georgians , demanding that georgia immediately halt its insane provocation , otherwise russia would not be responsible for any conflict that resulted from it . 
media reported that on $date georgian defense minister okruashvili announced that the head of the russian military base in akhalkalaki sold the south ossetians a number of missiles used in strela - type portable anti - aircraft missile systems . 
on the same day , the georgian parliamentary committee on defense and security held a general assembly and , after hearing a report by the law - enforcement department , decided to expel the russian peacekeepers inside georgia 's border and ask the general parliamentary assembly on the $number to deliberate on the matter . 
specialists believe that once the final decision is made , it could lead to a final and complete breakdown in relations between georgia and russia . 
prior to this , georgian minister of minister of foreign affairs bezhuashvili vehemently criticized the russian position and rejected russian president putin 's discourse that if the west recognized kosovo , russia might recognize abkhazia and south ossetia , saying that the russian government was sending out encouraging signals to all separatist regions . 
prior to this , the russian ministry of foreign affairs also said that it would protect russians in south ossentia , thereby implying a threat of military force directly against georgia . 
lu yuguan , phoenix satellite television , reporting from moscow . 
admiral roughead , commander of the us pacific fleet , announced on tuesday that this summer the us ... eh ... would dispatch four aircraft carriers to the asia - pacific region to hold the largest military exercise in the past decade . 
roughead also said that the us ... eh ... would not view china as a threat . 
the us military hopes to be able to hold joint exercises with the pla navy again . 
this statement immediately aroused the attention of us defense experts . 
on wednesday , the american think - tank the heritage foundation held a workshop on the pentagon 's defense review . 
the subtle relationship between the report and the military exercise became one of the focuses of discussion . 
some people hold that roughead 's open invitation to china to take part in the exercise is an olive branch held out to china by the us . 
while inviting china to take part in the exercise , the us military also expressed the hope that the operations of pla would be more transparent . therefore , some defense experts believe that this is evidence that the pentagon is unclear about china 's intention to expand its military force and hopes to use the joint military exercise as an opportunity for mutual probing and sounding out . 
furthermore , because the defense review released by the pentagon early this month regards china as the greatest potential threat in the future , two defense experts have pointed out that the asia - pacific military exercise is $number step taken by the us department of defense to adjust its strategy on this basis . 
this is reported by xie xiaoshuang of phoenix tv from washington . 
furthermore , ... eh ... the military exercise held by the us this summer is being watched carefully because this is $number time in the past decade that the us ... eh ... will have four aircraft carriers in a military exercise at the same time and also $number time since the vietnam war that the us will move aircraft carriers from its east coast to the western pacific region for such a military exercise . 
and the military exercise ... eh ... actually , it is carried out frequently , and will occur four times in these few months ... 
eh ... one of them will be a multinational military exercise . 
this multinational military exercise will include japan , south korea and australia . 
now let 's take a look at today 's headlines .

balochistan police described the incident as an open terrorist attack and said the armed militants has shot and killed innocent chinese . 
pakistan 's ministry of foreign affairs issued a statement promising to strengthen security safeguards for other chinese engineering personnel and at the same time to intensify efforts to apprehend the killers who carried out the attack . 
this is a news brief by phoenix satellite television . 
elsewhere , the pakistan ministry of foreign affairs issued a statement on the evening of the $number strongly condemning the incident that afternoon in which three chinese engineers were shot to death and called the incident an act of terrorism . 
the statement said the government and people of pakistan strongly condemn the shooting deaths of the chinese engineers .

eh ... after learning the news , he expressed deep concern for the safety of chinese technical personnel working in pakistan . 
then , hu jintao , he immediately instructed the ministry of foreign affairs and china 's embassy and consulates in pakistan to pressure the pakistani authorities to apprehend the assailants , ensure the safety of chinese personnel in pakistan and , eh , appropriately handle arrangements related to those who were killed . 
in addition , hu jintao also expressed profound sorrow for the tragic deaths of the chinese personnel and expressed his sincere condolences to their families . 
okay , regarding this issue , we are now going to contact chen yiming , reporter for the people 's daily in islamabad , in order to find out the newest developments . 
hello , mr. chen . 
can you give us the newest developments in the investigation into the shooting deaths of chinese engineers ? 
eh , yes , anchorman . 
eh , from what i 've been able to learn from the chinese consulate - general in karachi regarding the situation , the ... eh ... chinese embassy and consulate have , uh , informed the unit to which the victim 's belonged of the tragedy . 
and , eh , according to standard procedure , then , uh , arrangements for the victim 's remains should be carried out after consulting with their work unit and their , uh , families . 
furthermore , pakistan 's ministry of foreign affairs also issued a statement yesterday . 
their , uh , statement said that , uh , the provocateurs in this incident were aiming to create tension in relations between china and pakistan . 
um , the statement says that a thorough investigation would be carried out into the incident and , eh , toward , uh , in pakistan , eh , strengthen security and protection measure for all chinese , eh , working in the country . it also says , um , the pakistani authorities would do everything they could to prevent the reoccurrence of similar incidents . 
um , in addition , according to a report on the evening of the $number by pakistan 's privately - owned television station geo , the ceo of the attock cement factory in pakistan , bashir , said that evening during , eh , in an interview with that station that in the aftermath of the attack pakistan would organize as soon as possible the repatriation of the remaining eleven chinese engineers and technicians working on the construction of the cement project . 
and this bashir also said during the interview that , in regard to questions by pakistani media as to why , uh , at the time of the incident the chinese engineers were not accompanied by security personnel , uh , he said , eh , that in actuality the cement plant where the engineers worked had its own security system but that because the location of the incident was still within the limits of the factory area there were no accompanying security personnel when the incident took place . 
he expressed his extreme regret over the tragic incident . 
anchorman . 
um , okay . 
uh , in addition , this is actually not $number time that chinese engineering personnel have been killed in attacks in pakistan . 
a similar incident occurred in $date . 
two chinese engineers were kidnapped by an armed group in south waziristan . 
in the end , one of the individuals was tragically killed in the rescue operation . 
also , three engineers were killed in a bomb attack in gwador in may of the same year . 
let 's take a look back . 
on $date , in the port of gwador in the south of the pakistani province of balochistan , a vehicle carrying twelve chinese headed toward a worksite at the port was hit by a car bomb attack . 
as a result , three chinese engineers were killed and nine individuals were injured . 
local armed separatists and tribal militants are believed to have launched the attack . 
on $date of the same year , two chinese engineers were kidnapped by armed militants in the area of south waziristan in the border region between pakistan and afghanistan . 
a short while after , one engineer was fatally shot as pakistani troops were rescuing the hostages . 
however , it is believed that the hostage - taking was carried out by armed militants linked to al qaeda and not armed separatists . 
because china has close economic ties with pakistan and participates in infrastructure projects in that country , several chinese engineers work there . 
on the other hand , there are also armed tribal groups in pakistan that accuse the government of plundering their natural resources . 
this has resulted in chinese becoming the victims of attacks or kidnappings on several occasions . 
this is a news brief by phoenix satellite television . 
let 's take a look at some news items from japan . 
recently , japan 's political arena produced some rather sensational news . 
that is , tsuneo watanabe , chairman of one of japan 's leading papers , the yomiuri shimbun , he ordered yomiuri shimbun to publish some articles ... eh ... that oppose koizumi 's visit to the yasukuni shrine , marking yomiuri shimbun 's shift to a stand against koizumi 's visit to yasukuni shrine . 
eh ... so ... this tsuneo watanabe ... , in the speech he made a few days ago , he also lashed out at koizumi ... , saying that he is ignorant and has no historical and cultural knowledge . 
at the same time , he commented that visiting yasukuni shrine was just like paying tribute to hitler and said that , in so doing , koizumi ... eh ... had caused china and south korea to ... eh ... regard japan as a very dangerous country . this will bring endless troubles . 
so why has tsuneo watanabe 's attitude caused such a repercussion ? 
in fact , he is very influential in political circles and has always been a major behind - the - scenes operator . 
and he used to be a very rightist figure . 
it should be said that he has always been a supporter of the hawks and strongly advocated revision of the constitution . 
but , now , ... well ... this is really a major turn - around . 
he turned his gun and ... eh ... opened fire on koizumi , adopting an attitude of opposition . 
actually , $date , when koizumi was being criticized for visiting yasukuni shrine , this tsuneo watanabe ... he ... eh ... he said that he supported it and wanted koizumi to withstand the pressure . 
recently , however , he made a speech , saying : " i am $number years old and don 't have many days left . " 
so , he now stands up to make a high - profile speech with a very opposing attitude . 
such a turnaround of course produced a significant impact on the entire japanese society . 
just as tsuneo watanabe himself put it , he said : " i am convinced that i have the strength to control and change the direction of the political winds . " 
and he also said that he would put up a desperate resistance if the government pressured yomiuri shimbun with respect to its freedom of speech or its ability to interview . 
so , what has the situation come to now ? 
well , japan 's largest newspaper , yomiuri shimbun , and $number largest newspaper , asahi shimbu ... eh , these two leading newspapers have started to team up in opposition to koizumi 's visit to yasukuni shrine . 
originally , the two papers were opponents , but after the two chairmen met , they were able to reach agreement on this issue at least . 
therefore , they have now launched a campaign of considerable scale to criticize koizumi . you can say that they have formed an ideal combination . 
actually , these two large newspapers have great sway over mainstream public opinion in japan . 
in a separate development , let 's look at the meeting of the japanese parliament . at a recent meeting , two candidates favored to succeed prime minister junichiro koizumi made the same type of remarks . 
who were the two ? 
one was chief cabinet secretary shinzo abe and the other was minister for foreign affairs taro aso , who of late has frequently made astonishing remarks . 
what did the two say ? 
they said that japanese war criminals of $number world war were not criminals . 
what they mean is ... eh ... that , they claimed that these criminals ... it was the intention of the international court to convict them . 
but , in japan , according to international laws ... they were citing the domestic laws of japan ... eh ... the war criminals ... did not break the domestic laws of japan . 
so , they think that , in japan , world war ii criminals should not be regarded as criminals . 
this shinzo abe ... he also mentioned that japan now ... eh ... should take the whole world into account , develop relations with the united states and develop commercial and trade relations with some east asian countries , and , furthermore , it should also try to develop closer ties with india rather than always focus on china . 
china 's new e - banking regulations take effect $date 
beijing , $date ( xinhua ) ( reporter : han jie , xu bo ) reporters were informed on the $number by the china banking regulatory commission (cbrc) that two rules recently issued by the cbrc - - the electronic banking administration measures and the electronic banking security assessment guide - - will take effect on $date . 
a cbrc spokesman said that according to provisions of the administration measures , the examination and authorization method for foreign - capital financial institutions remains essentially unchanged . namely , if foreign bank branches that have already been authorized to open online banking services need to add additional online banking products , their primary reporting bank must submit a consolidated application . 
, in $date , the china people 's bank promulgated the interim measures for the administration of online banking operations to standardize use of the internet by commercial banks in developing banking services . 
a cbrc spokesman said that with the continuous development of the online banking operations of commercial banks , the interim measures no longer answered the need for supervision and control of risks in online banking . for this reason , the cbrc enacted the two new regulations . 
according to the cbrc spokesman , the cbrc 's approval of the qualifications of security assessment organizations is different from the administrative approval of qualifications for industry access or market access . it is not a prerequisite for assessment organizations developing electronic banking security assessment services , but is instead only a reference for financial institutions choosing an assessment organization . 
financial institutions can hire a security assessment organization to perform e - banking security assessments as long as the assessment organization complies with relevant conditions and requirements , even if its qualifications have not undergone cbrc approval . assessments must however be supervised in accordance with relevant regulations . 
the electronic banking administration measures are divided into $number items under nine chapters covering general principles , application and change of registration , risk management , management of information exchange and transfer , supervision of out - sourcing , supervision of trans - national business , oversight and administration , legal liability and supplementary provisions . 
the electronic banking security assessment guide is divided into $number items under five chapters , covering general principles , security assessment organizations , implementation of security assessments , administration of security assessment activity and supplementary provisions . 
publication and distribution of " speeches , investigations and study papers by mao zedong , zhou enlai , liu shaoqi , zhu de , deng xiaoping and chen yun " 
beijing , $date ( xinhua ) the book " speeches , investigations and study papers by mao zedong , zhou enlai , liu shaoqi , zhu de , deng xiaoping and chen yun " , edited by the party literature research center of the cpc central committee , was recently published and distributed by the literature publishing house of the cpc central committee .

( newspaper excerpt ) shanghai : part - timers and university grads become main source of hourly workers .

chinese experts : us making groundless accusations by playing up " china military threat " 
beijing , $date ( xinhua ) ( reporters : li xuanliang , xiong zhengyan , lin liping ) in the quadrennial defense review it formally submitted recently to congress , the us pentagon has said for $number time that china is " the emerging power that has the greatest potential to militarily challenge the united states .

" this is almost equal to the total of the defense expenditures of the rest of the world 's countries . "

( international observation ) hamas seeks breakthrough in forming cabinet 
ramallah , $date ( xinhua ) ( international observation ) hamas seeks breakthrough in forming cabinet 
( xinhua reporters : wang hao , huang min ) 
following the victory of palestine 's islamic resistance movement ( hamas ) in parliamentary elections , how the new government will be laid out has become a focus of international attention . 
what kind of policies hamas carries out will directly influence the policy directions taken by the various parties involved in the peace process . 
at the same time , the resistant attitude of the us and israel will be an additional variable in the prospects of the hamas - lead government . 
at present , the different palestinian sides are stepping up discussions in an active quest for a breakthrough in problems and sensitive issues that the cabinet formation poses toward future development of the situation . 
( subhead ) who will become prime minister ? 
since hamas won the right to form a cabinet , some outsiders have expressed worry that a split could take place between the " hamas prime minister " and the palestinian leader , abbas . 
in addition , the leader of hamas , mashaal , who is currently visiting egypt , stressed that a palestinian government formed by the leaders of hamas would not recognize israel , a hard - line signal that heightened international concern . 
the us and israel have clearly stated they will not accept a hamas - led government with real power and have threatened to cut off economic aid to palestine and freeze the transfer of tax revenues . 
but this has not prevented hamas from carrying out some agile strategic adjustments , including a compromise policy of selecting independents . 
according to reports , in order to maximize recognition from the international community , in recent days overseas and domestic leaders of hamas gathered in egypt decided to select an independent figure , ismail haniyeh , chairman of the board of gaza islamic university , to become the new prime minister . 
concerned parties have not yet responded to the move . 
palestinian analyst hisham said that , whoever takes over the prime - ministership , the most important thing is that the person should be capable of toning down hamas ' hard - line character , since only in this way can the success of the cabinet be guaranteed . 
( subhead ) how will authority be distributed ? 
from an internal perspective , the biggest challenge faced by the hamas - led cabinet is a lack of adequate experience in power . 
an analysis in an article in the palestinian daily al - ayyam said that hamas gained popularity through social welfare projects but lacked experience in office . cooperation with the palestinian national liberation movement , or fatah , will be the best solution . 
after the election , hamas raise the possibility of a " political partnership " with fatah and the joint establishment of a national coalition government , but until now fatah has not given a positive response . 
fatah is internally split regarding whether to participate in the cabinet . one faction advocates taking part in the new government in order to have some sway ; another faction refuses the invitation by hamas and wants instead to be " an active opposition " in parliament . 
informed sources say fatah , with persuasion coming from abbas , is gradually leaning toward participating in the new government . 
even so , hamas and fatah will still haggle over the distribution of cabinet posts . 
another path would be to establish a cabinet outside the parliamentary framework and ignore party affiliation . 
according to reports , hamas has also laid out a government composed uniquely of experts , but the actual name list is still unknown . 
in view of us and israeli attitudes , a government of technical experts is a way of forming a cabinet that will help lighten pressure from outside . 
palestine 's basic law provides that the naming of the prime minister and the cabinet will take three to five weeks to complete once the new parliament takes over on the $number of this month . 
( subhead ) how do the weapons fit in ? 
hamas ' weapons constitute another thorny issue in the forming of the new government . 
the us and israel have an extremely hard - line attitude , insisting that hamas renounce violence and refusing to let it take part in the government while armed . 
the leader of hamas , mashaal , emphasized on the $number that armed resistance is the organization 's " strategic choice " . 
the issue of weapons in reality includes two levels : the legality of weapons and the administration of jurisdiction over armed forces . 
that hamas became the largest party in parliament through a democratic and free election has been recognized internationally . it will , through similarly legal methods , try to integrate its armed branch , the al - qassam brigade , into the government 's security apparatus . 
hamas has floated in the past the idea of unifying all the armed factions into a palestinian national force , or " people 's army " , but the idea was not widely acknowledged and was even criticize by the palestine islamic jihad . 
palestine currently has $number security personnel , the vast majority of which are from the fatah camp . 
in addition , fatah also has some loose organizational ties to affiliated armed factions such as the al - aqsa martyrs brigade and the fatah hawks . 
responsible for forming a cabinet , hamas will have to come to terms with fatah regarding how to manage these various self - governing armed groups and reasonably distribute power over the security administration . 
according to local media reports , abbas wants to oversee the security and intelligence forces . the police and civil defense forces would be overseen by the internal affairs department of the new government . 
but the various sides are still negotiating this sensitive issue and until now there have been no developments .

japanese researchers develop new model of highly effective artificial kidney 
tokyo , $date ( xinhua ) ( reporter : qian zheng ) researchers at tokai university in japan have developed a bioartificial kidney . it not only possesses the same catabolic functions as a human kidney , but at the same time is also able to retain useful material components . additionally , it is small in size and easy to transplant . as more detailed research is carried out , there is hope that it could be good news for people with kidney disease . 
according to a recent report by the japan light industry news , the newly developed bioartificial kidney consists primarily of two parts . one part is composed of " artificial nephrons " that filter metabolic matter and water from blood ; the other part consists of the " artificial renal tubules " the extracts water , amino acids and other useful elements from the primary urine and returns them to the blood . 
the artificial nephrons and the artificial renal tubules are all made from hollow silk thread . the inner wall of the artificial renal tubules is also covered with a layer of tubule epithelial cells capable of breaking down waste . 
this kind of epithelial cell can cause the materials that lead to a disease stemming from chronic dialysis - - dialysis - related amyloidosis - - to be broken down into amino acids and then returned to the blood . at the same time , it can also cause the glucose , vitamins and minerals needed by the body to reenter the blood . 
in the past , artificial kidneys have relied on differences in osmotic pressure to filter metabolic waste but have been unable to eliminate it completely . they were also unable to return amino acids and other components to the blood . 
the researchers conducted experimental transplants of the bioartificial kidney in goats . epithelial cells from pigs were used to make the inner wall of the hollow threads of the artificial kidney . 
two weeks later , the researchers confirmed that the artificial kidney had successfully served its function . 
they are currently developing a bioartificial kidney that uses human kidney cells and will conduct clinical studies after its safety has been verified .

control of gas this year must give prominence to " draining gas before mining coal " . 
if high gassy mines fail to " drain gas before mining coal " , they will be legally ordered to immediately halt production . 
- - continue to wage an aggressive fight to consolidate and close mines . 
the $number coal - mine and coal - pit closures already announced to the public must be carried out one by one , as must the $number other closures recently announced in various regions . 
closures must become a part of routine work , with coal mines that destroy resources , pollute the environment and fail to meet safety requirements being shut down without relent .

( winter olympic games ? doping ) news analysis : pyleva incident likely to end unsettled 
turin , $date ( xinhua ) news analysis : pyleva incident likely to end unsettled 
( reporters : gao peng , ding ying ) 
italy has reiterated on several occasions that all athletes found doping during the turin winter olympics could face a " prison term " , but judging from things as they stand now , chances are slim that this will happen to russian biathlete olga pyleva , leading figure in $number doping scandal of these winter olympics . 
on the $number , the turin winter olympics saw its $number doping scandal uncovered when olga pyleva was found to have used carphedron , a banned drug . 
the following day , the international olympic committee announced that pyleva had been expelled from the winter olympics and stripped of the silver medal she won for the women 's $number individual biathlon at these winter olympics . 
the same day , the international winter biathlon union decided to ban her from competition for two years . 
it has been a consistent rule of the international olympic committee that any athlete found to have used performance - enhancing drugs at an olympics games will have his or her result cancelled and be disqualified from participation , but will receive no legal penalty . 
but under italian law , athletes commit a crime by carrying and using stimulants . judicial authorities have the power to directly arrest and investigate all athletes that use performance - enhancing drugs and punish violators with prison terms ranging from three months to three years . 
in $date last year , after one year of " bargaining " , the international olympic committee and the italian government finally reached an accord under which the two sides agreed to handle incidents involving doping athletes during this winter olympics in accordance with italian laws . 
following unremitting efforts by the international olympic committee , italian authorities conceded four days before the opening of the winter olympics to a promise that police would not enter the olympic village to search athletes ' dwellings during the winter olympic games . but athletes whose drug test proves positive will still be subject to investigation by italian prosecutors . 
reports say that pescante , the italian government official supervising the turin winter olympics , had referred the pyleva doping incident to prosecutors in turin . 
but neither the international olympic committee nor pescante himself has yet confirmed the report . 
russian biathlon team doctor andrey dmytriev disclosed at noon on the $number that pyleva had left turin to return to her country . 
shi kangcheng , a chinese sports official who worked for years in the world anti - doping agency , said that once pyleva returned home the case would very likely end up unsettled . 
shi kangcheng added that the international olympic committee and the italian government had never been " thorough " in their anti - doping drive at the winter olympics and the outcome would be hard to predict even if italian prosecutors did step in . 
based on past instances of punishment handed down to italian athletes that have used performance - enhancing drugs , the harshest punishment imposed on violators was no more than " two years of prison term served on probation " . 
for this reason , senior reporter of italy 's ansa [ pei ai ] predicted that the possibility of pyleva going to prison was " exceedingly slim " and that a fine would be the most she would receive . 
also said that although an italian court can pass judgment in absentia , it would be impossible for the italian police to bring her back from a foreign country for a prison term . 
if pyleva refused to accept a judgment , there would be no way italian authorities could detain her .

& lt ; headline & gt ; chance at the championship , but it 's not a sure thing 
& lt ; poster & gt ; love life , love lu neng 
the china football association super league is set for some fierce battles . 
luneng taishan is getting combat - ready for the new season with the championship in mind . 
hot competitions will be triggered between the dalian , shandong and shanghai teams , the three strongest competitors for the championship . 
in the end , who will win the championship ? 
based on an analysis of their strengths , taishan has a very good chance to become champion , but it is by no means a sure thing . 
$number of all , the new team members have not had long enough to get worked in . 
taishan lost at four major events last year . 
this year , taishan recruited two players from the national team - - li leilei and wang liang . with the addition of two foreign players soon afterwards , it is safe to say that the team will be stronger . 
but because the national football team is preparing for matches with palestine and iraq , there no way to say how well the two players from the national team will integrate . 
by the time they return to the club , league matches will be set to begin . 
that is why integration has become the most significant issue taishan is facing . 
in my view , the national - team players can be used as backups in $number few rounds of league matches . 
$number , team integration can be achieved using the in - game training . 
$number , the national - team players who have just played group matches with the national team can use the lull to rest up . 
after a few rounds , when the " knife is well sharpened ' , it will not be too late for them to play top spots . 
in addition , the defense has some weaknesses . 
last year , taishan 's fans had some unfavorable things to say about the team 's defense . 
this year , the defense will have improved with the recruitment of li leilei . but it 's still not the time to sit back and relax . 
there 's still the problem of sluggish turnaround at the center back position , and the substitutes for this position are either too old or lacking in experience . 
if performance at the center back position can be stabilized , taishan will gain some momentum on the road to becoming champion . 
in my opinion , they might as well use ren yongshun , who is strong physically . although he lacks experience , he should be put to work this year so as to be ready in the future . 
in addition , gao yao can play center back as well . 
taishan has quite a few players who can play defending midfield , such as cui peng and hai bing . 
gao yao is physically very strong and a ferocious interceptor . he should be able to handle the center back position . 
another question is whether the foreign recruits can adjust . 
taishan has been plagued by problems with foreign recruits . 
the performance of daniel [ daniel danciulescu ] last year was far from stellar . 
we know that this year 's selection of foreign players has not yet been finalized . 
i think that apart from bringing in an excellent striker , a true left - footed midfielder should also be recruited this year . 
except for xing rui , who played for the team a few years ago , taishan has not had a true left - footed player with good skills . 
although players like cui peng and other can play the position , a truly competent left half back would be greatly preferred to fill - in . 
if these three issues can be solved , taishan 's road to the championship should be somewhat smoother . 
as a shandong football fan , i 'm really hoping taishan can win the championship this year . 
but to be frank , with things looking like they do in the championships this year , taishan has a good chance , but it is far from a sure thing . 
& lt ; headline & gt ; the incorporation of batey ads into jwt 's network : is it too late to say happy new year ? 
& lt ; poster & gt ; brandvista post : 
hello , everybody . 
once again , the chinese new year has flown by and those who combined their vacation time with their new year 's holiday are now returning to their jobs . 
we wish all our friends a happy new year , if it is not too late to say happy new year . 
we spoke recently at a cafe with nplcn . he talked about present - day brandvista . 
the appearance of the website has improved greatly . 
the content is well structured . 
what pleases him most is the discuz - powered community bbs , which has undergone a thorough revamping . 
in regards to the community , i must thank one person . 
that is , mr. li mingshun , general manager of discuz beijing . 
if you search for his name in google , you will get a slew of hits . 
you probably know that he was previously with sina . he later started his own business , setting up an internet advertisement exchange platform for smes that was similar to the overseas website adbrite.com . 
we discussed it with him at the time on msn . what he said , in general , was that : brandvista felt that the development of many industries in china depended on the expansion of the private economy and smes . 
and currently , in the chinese market , this situation does not give reason for optimism . 
so sme 's in creative industries and similar services are unable to provide consultation to any significant extent . 
collecting high fees to advance one 's own development in the end leads to a discouraging cycle . 
later , he came to discuz . 
discuz is an outstanding forum program powered by php and mysql . 
with the help of ramboo , a technical engineer from beijing , brandvista finally saw the light of day once again and hit the stage with matchless freshness . 
the feedback was very good . 
the interface was neat and friendly . 
it was also very fast . 
with the neat interface , writing a few words that moved me and inspired others , exchanging tidbits about work and life with friends from the same industry that shared the same pursuits , i began to find that this was a pleasure . 
thank you discuz !

large foreign companies have been arriving one after another . small foreign companies are sharpening their sword for battle . it seems to be a scene of prosperity . 
batey ads , which rose to prominence in singapore , has been having many difficulties . 
having lost a string of big clients and having suffered repeated setbacks in its development in mainland china , martin boase finally took a little time from a lawsuit in italy to think about shuffling things around . 
batey ads will merge into jwt 's network , keeping its own brandname and being managed by jwt . 
however , at the same time , there were also rumors that bates and $number network would merge into the ogilvy and mather system and be managed by the ogilvy and mather network . 
even if $number had already given its report to ogilvy and mather prior to that , having ted bates get payback against ogilvy and mather is also a interesting matter . 
during the spring festival , several articles on the website were updated . we won 't go into each one here .

& lt ; headline & gt ; a mother ten years in the past 
& lt ; poster & gt ; helen li 
i saw this article and decided to share it with you ; 
this is not a momentary impulse , but rather a warm kindheartedness that has long existed in the heart . 
i asked myself what i would do if it were me . 
the answer is very clear . i would way , " you have the wrong number " and hang up the telephone . 
i 've been thinking all this year about how one can actually help someone . 
i have already given up on actions such as donating money or goods . 
a couple days ago a friend said , " i already have no spare time to take care of myself . as for helping people , the heart is there by the means are not . " 
have a nice day : )

a mother ten years in the past 
it was a day ten years ago . the teacher was using the lunch break to nap at home , when suddenly the telephone rang . 
she answered and heard an unfamiliar rough voice from the receiver : " your child stole a book and we caught her . come over right away ! " 
the crying of a little girl could also be heard though the receiver , as well as the sound of somebody nearby scolding her . 
she turned her head to look at her only daughter watching the television and then immediately understood what was happening . 
clearly , a little girl had been caught by a store clerk stealing a book and did not want her family to find out , so she dialed a number at random and happened to call there . 
of course , she could hang up and forget about it , or even reprimand the party on the other line , 
because this affair had absolutely nothing to do with her . 
but she was a teacher , and it could be that it was one of her students . 
through the telephone , she could roughly imagine that the little girl who had made a mistake on the spur of the moment was surely terrified , since she was facing what could be life 's most frightening circumstance . 
after hesitating a moment , a thought suddenly came to her mind . yes , she would do it . 
thereupon , after asking the bookstore 's address , she rushed over there . 
just as she had anticipated , standing in the bookstore was a little girl with a face full of tears . 
the adults beside her were ferociously and loudly scolding her . 
she instantly rushed forward and gathered the pitiful little girl into her arms , then turned toward the nearby store clerk and said : " whatever you have to say you can say to me . you shouldn 't frighten children . " 
during the muttering of the somewhat unwilling store clerk , she paid the fine of less than $number yuan and then , with the little girl in hand , walked out of the store where she could see clearly the face overwhelmed by panic and tears . 
she smiled and returned home with the little girl where she tidied her up without asking anything , then let the little girl leave , 
as the little girl was about to go , she also made a point of urging , " if you want to read a book , then come here to auntie 's house . there are lots of books here . ' 
the still badly shaken little girl looked are her deeply for a moment , then dashed off , after which she never came back . 
time rushed by like running water . imperceptibly , ten years went by in a flash . 
she had forgotten the incident , still living there as before , she led a calm and peaceful life . 
one afternoon , there was a knocking on the outside door . 
opening the door to her apartment , she saw a pretty young woman she did not know . the girl was smiling broadly and in her hands she held a stack of presents . 
" who are you looking for ? " 
she asked with uncertainty . 
the young girl excitedly gave a long explanation . 
to her surprise , from the unfamiliar young lady 's story she suddenly realized that the young woman was actually the little girl from that year . ten years later , she had graduated from university without difficulty and had now come especially to call on her . 
the young woman 's eyes glistened with tears as she said in a gentle voice : " although i still don 't understand even today why you were willing to pass yourself off as my mother and come to my rescue , but for the last ten years i had a constant feeling that i wanted to cry out ' mother ' to you . " 
the teacher 's eyes started to cloud over as well . 
somewhat curious , she asked : " if i hadn 't helped you that day , what would have been the result ? " 
the young woman 's face instantly darkened and she lightly shook her head , saying : " i 'm not sure . maybe i would have gone on doing stupid things , or i might even have died . " 
a violent shiver went through the teacher 's heart , then she rejoiced to herself . 
the impetuous decision that she had made back then had unexpectedly had such an influence on a person 's entire life . 
looking at the happy smile on the young woman 's face , she also began to smile .

while the world is full of lies and cheating that fill the air like junk messages , buddha says , " who would enter hell but i would enter it ... " 
whoever is willing to do that , i congratulate him . he will achieve buddhahood sooner . 
human nature is good at the outset . 
everybody has a compassionate heart . 
the world is going to the dogs and people 's hearts have changed . 
perhaps only by abandoning one 's own buddha can one do a little good . 
& lt ; headline & gt ; military observation : how long can iran hold out under us air attacks ? 
& lt ; poster & gt ; yun feiquan 
if we describe conventional war of attrition as causing the opponent to bleed to death , then from the outset modern warfare consists of shooting a gun toward the opponent 's head in order to render him a " vegetable " even before there is time to bleed . 
the disparity between the military capabilities of iran and the us is not one of quantity , but rather in the understanding of modern war . 
iran , which fought a victorless eight - year war with iraq , seems not yet to have understood the true significance of modern hi - tech warfare . 
following an analysis of us military deployments , britain 's " international intelligence - - commentary " recently said that the us military is carrying out preparations to launch a large scale air assault on iran ...... 
the current status of iran 's air force is cause for concern . 
the present situation of iran 's air force is quite similar to that of iraq 's air force prior to the $number war . 
the country does not possess the capacity to research and develop modern weapons on its own and is also under an arms embargo imposed by the west . 
once war breaks out , it is uncertain whether the antiquated planes in iran 's air force will be able to take to the air to engage us forces . 
at present , iran 's air - defense system consists primarily of an air force belonging to iran 's regular forces , the land - based air - defense force and the air - defense capacity of the revolutionary guard . 
of these , iran 's air force presently has a manpower of $number and $number aircraft of various models . 
the most important aircraft models include us - manufactured f-4 phantoms , f5 tigers , f-14 tomcats and russian - manufactured mig-29s . 
the land - based air - defense force is primarily equipped with surface - to - air missiles of the us - manufactured hawk series and the british rapier series , as well as a portion belong to the russian - manufactured sam series . 
with regards to the current status of iran 's air - defense strength , analysis by individuals such as the us military expert harold hutchison and military expert [ hela muqixin ] of the [ russian political and military research institute ] indicates that , viewed from the present situation , there are still holes in iran 's air - defense capabilities and air - defense system . 
hutchison says that with respect to overall capabilities , iran 's air force simply is not on the same level as the us air force . 
a large number of the us - manufactured jetfighters that iran is equipped with cannot be used because of a lack of spare parts and upgrading . 
the f-14 fighter was once the trump card of iran 's air force , but today there are only ten or so that are able to fly . 
the dependability in actual combat of the aim-54 phoenix missiles they carry , known for their ultra - long distance attack capabilities , is also doubtful . 
[ hela muqixin ] points out however that the air - defense missile systems provided to iran by the us $date and $date have lost their warfare capabilities because of a lack of spare parts . 
in addition , the other non - systematic air - defense weapons obtained from russia and other countries are simply incapable of countering us forces possessing powerful electromagnetic countermeasure capabilities . 
scraping together a military affects battle capability 
clearly , iran 's government is also aware that its fate in a conflict depends upon whether it can defend the sky above and it has been carrying out $number - hour preparations by scraping together whatever it can find in order to build up its air - defense system . 
at present , its methods can be summarized into two devices : 
$number is an all - out effort to conceal key nuclear facilities and beef up their defense capabilities . 
according to a report in the british newspaper the times , iran has hidden the natanz nuclear facility , the isfahan uranium enrichment center and other core components of their nuclear facilities eighteen meters underground and added a two - meter thick concrete protection shell . 
but the us military is one step ahead . as early as the $number persian gulf war , it saw the effectiveness of underground bunkers in anti - aircraft defense and rushed to develop various types of earth - penetrating bombs . 
after ten years of focused research , the us military has a full complement of strategies and weapons to counter reinforced underground bunkers . 
iran has recently also bought a large amount of advanced air - defense weapons from russia . 
since the end of last year , iran 's government has reached a series of agreements with russia to purchase pechora-2a air defense missile systems as well as $number tor - m1 air - defense missile systems valued at us $ 7 0 0 m . 
however , modern warfare is a contest of system against system . 
the various air - attack weapons of the us military have all been developed by the country itself for its own benefit and , through many years of perfectioning in actual combat , they have been molded into an impressive war machine . 
on the other hand , iran 's " up - to - date weapons " have been scraped together from other countries . whether or not they can be made combat effective in such a short time is still in question . 
iran 's lags behind not only in weapons 
the concept of " air - land battle " was $number raised in " operations " , published by the us military $date . it stresses reliance on strength in the air to carry out attacks against the enemy 's strategically valuable targets . this paralyses the other side 's command systems at the start of the war and turns the enemy 's conventional forces , even if they are superior , into a " slab of meat on a cutting board . " 
in the $number persian gulf war , the $number kosovo war and the $number iraq war , the us military did not concern itself with how many planes the opponent had , but rather the range of its own tomahawk cruise missiles . 
even if iran 's government has prepared for a possible air attack and has begun to take steps to reinforce its air - defense capabilities , iran , which fought to a stalemate in an eight - year war with iraq , seems not to have fully understood the true meaning of modern hi - tech warfare . 
with the progress of the us military 's military transformation in recent years , the us military 's air - attack operations are completely different from the carpet bombing of the vietnam war and instead rely on full - depth air assaults with various hi - tech weapons and modern information technology . 
faced with this kind of air assault , how long iran 's land - based air defense systems can hold out is an unknown .

& lt ; headline & gt ; joining hands with google to battle microsoft : will dell charge microsoft " top - shelf fees " ? 
& lt ; poster & gt ; yun feiquan 
dell inc . ( us : dell ) and google confirmed on tuesday that dell is currently testing pcs installed with google 's software pack . 
this step could form a significant threat to microsoft 's ( microsoftcorp . , msft ) dominant position in the pc software market . 
dell spokesman jess blackburn said the company is currently evaluating google 's software . 
after the software has been installed , the pc - user will be able to use the software to conduct searches on the internet as well as search through information stored on the pc . 
blackburn confirmed that the software being evaluated by the company includes a google - supported dell homepage , a google desktop search tool and a google tool bar . 
at the same time , google spokesman jon murchinson also confirmed that the company was working with dell in testing a software bundle developed by google . 
earlier , a report in the wall street journal had said that it upstart google was in talks with dell and hewlett - packard in an attempt to convince the computer manufacturing giants to install google software in their computers . 
according to an insider quoted by the wall street journal , in order to achieve this end , google may have to pay up to us $ 3 bn over the next three years . 
however , the two companies have not disclosed any relevant details . 
furthermore , hp still refuses to issue a comment . 
microsoft spokesman neil charney refused to comment on the above information . 
currently , microsoft is planning to launch a search tool for the next generation of its windows operating system and strengthen the development of its online business . 
on the day of the news statement , shares in google fell another $number to us $ $number . 
shares in microsoft fell that day by $number to close at us $ $number . 
some analysts say that google is eagerly seeking to expand in a direction beyond web searching and that linking up with dell and other pc giants could prompt google to threaten microsoft in its core businesses . 
matt rosoff , analyst with the market research firm directions on microsoft , says that microsoft is unquestionably concerned and worried by google 's eagerness to expand into other sources of revenue . 
but other analysts strongly disagree . 
charles di bona , analyst with market research firm sanford c. bernstein , says that it is still too early to talk about google shaking windows ' dominate position . 
reporter handbook : is google shaking up microsoft 's landscape ? 
hui zhengyi 
without doubt , the computer has become a necessity in modern man 's life and work . 
but while everybody has become familiar with operating computers , only a small portion of people understand the working principles behind a computer . 
just like with an " idiot " camera , if the interface is friendly and the software is convenient and quick to use , the vast majority of " newbies " can find their way around the black box that is a computer . 
for this reason , the software originally installed by the pc manufacturer more often than not determines the usage habits of most consumers . 
indeed , it was through this measure that microsoft took firm hold of the market for pc operating systems . 
now , microsoft 's new rival , google , also intends to use this method to take a piece of the pie . 
in regards to this , a well - known organization in the taiwanese economic media recently made an interesting analogy . 
" dell , hp and other computer manufacturers are starting to treat the computers they produce as supermarket shelves and they are charging 'top shelf fees ' to software companies . 
the winning bidder can cause its software to appear in the 'crucial ten minutes ' after the user turns on the new computer and thereby induce the consumer to use their product . 
this type of fee method is like the top - shelve fees charged by supermarkets to food companies . " 
without doubt , this phenomenon indicates that microsoft 's control is being shaken . 
microsoft 's managers have warned bill gates , saying that if google starts paying money to pc manufacturers in order to have computers shipped with google software installed , then microsoft 's position as overlord will ultimately be threatened . 
whatever the final outcome , microsoft 's easy days safely perched at the top of the ladder might become history . 
after all , keeping a market is much more difficult than creating a market . 
there are no big issues in quanda 's eyes . all issues in the world are common issues .

the sword of righteousness : outlook for $number 
author : sword of righteousness 
i remember that at the beginning of $number hong kong 's apple daily carried an article titled " falun rotates continuously and its gong may be able to defeat a regime " . 
the article states that $number was a year in which falun gong advanced triumphantly . 
the article lists examples of various occasions and situations where suppression of the falun gong movement by mainland china 's overseas officials failed and relates how falun gong practitioners speaking the truth around the world have caused mainland china to completely lose face . 
but $number doesn 't seem to have been anything special when compared to the powerful momentum of $number 's withdraw - from - the - party movement , which was caused by the book nine commentaries on the communist party . 
so , what will $number bring ? 
we can probably get a hint of how this year will develop from two events that occurred at the start of the year . 
one was the publication of " on eliminating evil " by the creator of falun gong . the article pronounced that , following $date , the final days of mainland china 's secret agents were nigh . 
as for this article , many people may half believe it or disbelieve it . 
but regardless of whether it is believed or not , history and facts will prove it ! 
of course , the chinese communist party 's secret agents are like rats that live in the sewers . 
their " natural or accidental " death will not attract the attention of society and public opinion . 
but the large scale striking down or repentance of the ccp 's overseas secret agents will inevitably deliver a heavy blow and a great shock to the power - wielding strata of the ccp . 
frightened by the awe - inspiring threat of being struck down , they have no choice but to carefully consider their own means of escape and survival - - - withdrawing from the party , defecting and fighting against the ccp . 
for this reason , the ccp 's " ultra - stable bureaucratic organization " , held together by squalid self interest , will start to move toward shakiness , disintegration and collapse ! 
another event was the human - rights hunger - strike protest movement launched by gao zhisheng . 
it erupted suddenly and initially wasn 't well - regarded , but it unexpectedly received an enthusiastic response from around the world as well as a collective response from people from all walks of life and various influential bodies . 
if this movement can become a bond bringing together the suffering people and various influential bodies fighting for justice , and can be made stronger , then there might be hope that the outside force that deals the final blow to the ccp , an evil regime in a very precarious situation , may take shape from here . 
if it can be said that $number was the year that the communist party was destroyed at the spiritual level , then $date things will have entered into the stage where the communist party is destroyed at the spiritual and material level . 
following further dissemination of the nine commentaries and growth in the wave of withdrawals from the party , the disintegration of the ccp and the consolidation of external forces fighting for justice , the countdown has begun for the end of the lifespan of the fiendish ccp ! 
the will of heaven and the will of the people have merged . the strength of the spirits and the strength of man are joining together . 
the heavenly sword is pointing straight at the demon ccp ! 
if it can be said that $number was a year of marching forward in militant song and $number was a year of moving forward with great momentum , then what will be the closing assessment of $number ? 
i hope it is an earthshaking radical change and triumphant return in victory !

& lt ; headline & gt ; xu zhiyong : a letter to li qun , party secretary of the linyi cpc municipal committee 
& lt ; poster & gt ; fa bulin 
sender : sunnypku ( sunny ) , 
mail list : square 
title : xu zhiyong : a letter to li qun , party secretary of the linyi cpc municipal committee - - by using hooligan tactics , you will harm yourselves too . 
website of origin : yjrg.net ( wed $date $time $number ) , current website ( yjrg.net ) 
as of yesterday , the government of linyi , of which you are the leader , has held chen guangcheng under illegal house arrest for $number days . 
you have joined with hooligan and gangland elements to illegally imprison a law - abiding citizen who is completely blind . 
you have cut his home 's telephone line and installed mobile phone interrupters in his courtyard . 
on several occasions , you have also beat him or members of his family . 
your barbaric acts have transgressed the lowest limits of civilized society . 
at the beginning of $date , you employed hooligan gangland tactics to beat the lawyer li fangping and myself , but we have been patient and have always done our best to understand the difficult situation you are in . for a period of time , we even tolerated that you had placed chen guangcheng under house arrest . 
but $number days have gone by and you still haven 't restrained yourselves . on the contrary , you have intensified your efforts . 
you have dispatched large contingents of police and thugs to harass the villagers . 
you have continued to arrest and beat villagers . 
you have gone too far ! 
today , as you continue to organize underworld thugs to surround chen guangcheng , we clearly warn you that thuggish underworld tactics will in turn come back to hurt you . 
you need to rethink this affair from its beginning . 
province wide , linyi ranks last in planned parenthood . 
as municipal party secretary , it is understandable that you are somewhat anxious . 
but you are mistaken in your belief that the people of linyi are of such low upbringing that it is necessary to use violence and coercion to implement state laws and policies . 
if citizens do not act in concert with the actions of government , in the end whose fault is it ? 
is it because the citizens are of low upbringing or is it because for a long time the government has engaged in so much lying and deception that its public credibility is too low ? 
assuming that ten years ago the same type of actions by government didn 't seem so outrageous , don 't you feel that , $date , when chinese society has made clear progress and human - rights guarantees have been written into the constitution , your savage acts seem ludicrous ? 
think about it for a moment . how is it that only you people in linyi dare to act this way ? 
how is it that only you people in linyi are unable to enforce the law using democratic and legal methods ? 
in the wake of the reports by chen guangcheng and other courageous citizens regarding the savage enforcement of laws , the brave intercedence by teng biao and other legal personnel to protect the rights of citizens , as well as the conclusions drawn from the investigation by the state family planning commission , the city of linyi could have , in good faith , offered an explanation and reached a compromise with the public . 
when all is said and done , family planning is a difficult problem that is specific to china . 
likewise , we can all empathize with the difficult situation you are in . 
but you nevertheless went on to employ outrageous measures - - arresting chen guangcheng and bringing him back from beijing to be held prisoner , then attempting to have him found guilty of illegally revealing state secrets . 
don 't you find it quite ludicrous to accuse a blind man from a poor mountain village of that crime ? 
actually , if you had truly corrected your errors , if you had acted correctly , would you fear the criticism of a blind man ? 
did you have to send several dozen people to keep watch over him $time a day and , flustered and exasperated , even have him accused of a crime ? 
on $date , attorney li fangping and i arrived in dong shigu village . we put forth a very clear position in the hope of resolving the conflict . 
we suggested that we could $number talk with your officials to see what thoughts and demands you had . 
we took the initiative of suggesting that we could help you persuade chen guangcheng that there are some things he should not say . 
we hoped that you would not treat a blind person in such a manner . there should be concessions from both sides . 
but your decision - makers clung obstinately to their course . furthermore , you unexpectedly came up with a " careful plan " - - beating us and detaining us illegally . 
do you think you can intimidate us in this way ? 
we haven 't done anything illegal , 
so we have nothing to fear . 
although the rule of law in china may not be perfect , but neither is it at the point of lawlessness . 
if you think you can use thuggish tactics to intimidate us , then you have greatly underestimated our determination and perseverance . 
if we want , there are many of us with abundant legal justifications to go to linyi or visit chen guangcheng . 
you can beat a lawyer or an academic once , twice , three times , and each time there will be widespread attention and reporting . 
do you really dare to beat us ten times ? 
isn 't it your official position that you are so worried about ? 
if the beatings actually result in somebody being injured , will your position be so assured ? 
you don 't listen to our rational advice , but instead resort to low - class ruffian tactics . don 't you find this very foolish and also very dangerous ? 
i want to make it clear to you that there is a large group of outstanding citizens in china that are devoted to the just adherence to the rule of law . 
we are not afraid of ruffian criminal elements . 
we will not tolerate the brazen trampling of the lowest limits of human civilization . 
if you go too far , we will confidently and calmly step forward , group after group , to welcome your clubs until the moment that you shrink back . 
you should understand clearly that the use of hooligan tactics is in no way a good thing for you . 
don 't think that after you retreat behind the scenes you will be able to break off your involvement with those local ruffians that beat villagers . 
finally , we also want to remind you that you should treat chen guangcheng well . 
blind since childhood , he graduated from collegial studies in chinese medicine and then taught himself law and english . in the past , he brought legal action against the beijing subway company in order to fight for the rights of blind people and also had running water installed for the villagers . he has become known near and far as " attorney chen " . 
you have unexpectedly mobilized unabashed flunkies to spread rumors and slander him on the internet and have attempted to have him sentenced with the crime of illegally providing secrets to foreigners . don 't you think that in doing so you have gone too far ? 
your house arrest of chen guangcheng is illegal . it is also dangerous for you yourself . 
at $number , you were fully capable of releasing him . 
inasmuch as the savage enforcement of the law had already ceased , he could criticize all he wanted , but how long would he go on ? 
but you are now steadily denigrating your own image . 
until cheng guangcheng obtains his freedom , you will not have a day of peace . 
you have persecuted him enough . 
if you try to have him convicted of a crime or attempt to use further thuggish tactics , we will not fold our arms and stand by .

& lt ; headline & gt ; ( fwd ) does the chinese nation deserve democracy ? 
& lt ; poster & gt ; explore the road to the peaceful liberation of china and advance the spiritual emancipation of the countrymen . 
with great disappointment , i admit that the chinese nation does not deserve democracy ! ! ! 
isn 't this what the people posting articles here have been doing ? 
the pity is that there won 't be many people ( compared to a population of $number ) coming online to read them . 
and there are even fewer people among the web surfers who care about or take part in such topics . i dare say , less than $number of them ! 
let alone the fact that this network is protected by the golden shield project , which is the largest , most complete , most invested and best quality system in the world ! 
indeed . 
i agonized , despaired , felt helpless and even thought of succumbing . but if we want to lead a life fit for humans , who can we count on to fight but ourselves ? 
man proposes and god disposes . yet even if i failed , i would hold myself to blame and deserve the life of a dog if i did not struggle for my own ideals . 
to struggle for something just in itself adds happiness to one 's life , at least in terms of one 's self - judgment in one 's own heart . 
actually , i have absolutely no need to worry about the future of china , 
because the global environment is already such that it will not permit the existence of a regime that has failed to hold elections for so long . 
it is merely a matter of time . 
i just sigh that the chinese nation could have been so lucky that , at every turn of history , it could always be led by world - class demons onto a marrow - and - blood - sucking road to hell . some people actually call the heaps of white bones and pools of blood on this road glory and force us to feel proud of such glory . 
although darkness exists everywhere , it is at its longest in china . 
qin shi huang and confucius caused the people to suffer so much . 
while qin shi huang persecuted openly , confucius brainwashed under the table . 
it 's not that the chinese do not deserve democracy . it 's that they no longer have democracy in their genes , which have all degenerated . 
a country with a history of $number years would have become democratic long ago if its national culture had a component for democracy . 
what were the chinese doing when athens established its democratic system , when rome founded the republic , when the british adopted their charter , when the french issued the declaration of human rights and when the americans published the declaration of independence ? 
before mongolians invaded the central plains , they elected their monarch through the kuraltai . in their early days , manchurians practiced a democratic system of ministerial meetings . why did all these fizzle out in the han regions ? 
chinese chase material goods and have no interest whatsoever in spiritual belief and political rights . 
you don 't believe it ? if the chinese were given universal suffrage , they would sell it to you for a single pie . 
$number thousand years later , it would need an earthquake for the chinese to want democracy . so run while you can !

& lt ; poster & gt ; beili of the cgp 
dalai lama 's envoys hold closed door talks with chinese officials . 
dalai lama stressed he wants autonomy , not independence , for tibet . 
envoys of tibet 's exiled spiritual leader the dalai lama are in china for closed door talks with chinese officials . details have not yet been released . 
this is $number official meeting since china and the dalai lama 's exiled government resumed contacts $date . 
but , as in the past , the two sides are meeting behind closed doors . no details have yet been disclosed . 
reporters say the two sides have held talks on several occasions , but so far there have been no tangible results . 
the dalai lama , who is in exile in northern india , says he wants autonomy , not independence , for tibet . 
china has refused to comment on the talks between the two sides . 
but analysts say beijing wants dialogue , partly because it fears the death of the $number - year - old spiritual leader in exile could lead to heightened sentiments among tibetans unhappy with china rule .

dalai lama 's envoy reiterates tibetan independence is not being sought 
dalai lama to visit washington this month 
in the run - up to the tibetan spiritual leader the dalai lama 's trip to the us on $date , his envoy has said that the tibetan government - in - exile is not seeking tibet 's independence . 
lodi gyaltsen gyari said in washington that he hopes that the chinese government will truly protect tibet 's unique culture and traditions . 
it is expected that during his visit to the us next week the dalai lama will discuss the tibet issue with president bush in the hope that bush will press the chinese government to give tibet genuine autonomy . 
in $date of this year , envoys of the dalai lama 's met with beijing 's officials in berne for their $number direct contact . 
" genuine autonomy " 
lodi gyaltsen gyari said that in recent years talks between the tibetan government - in - exile and the chinese authorities has revealed some positive elements . 
the envoys of the dalai lama found that the leaders in beijing , particularly the delegates of the ccp 's united front work department , are more willing than in the past to listen to their opinions . 
but lodi gyaltsen gyari said the tibetan government - in - exile and the chinese government still have several differences of opinion and are still far - apart in their standpoints . 
he said that in the last five years the tibetan government - in - exile has done its utmost to respond to china 's demands in order to create a favorable negotiating environment . 
in order to create a favorable negotiating environment on the tibetan issue , china should refrain from blindly pressuring the dalai lama . 
he said the dalai lama does not seek independence for tibet and that tibet is still a part of china , but that the chinese government must protect tibet 's unique culture and " allow the tibetan people genuine autonomy " . 
furthermore , lodi gyaltsen gyari said that some chinese people think that once the dalai lama has died the tibet issue will disappear . 
he said that this thinking is extremely dangerous because once the dalai lama is dead china will have lost a historic opportunity to solve the tibet issue . 
he said that the chinese government only needs to respond to the dalai lama 's demands and suggest a final means of resolution , then the dalai lama will no longer need to talk at the international level about the tibet issue . 
& lt ; headline & gt ; the key tools of democracy : negotiation and compromise ! (zt) 
& lt ; poster & gt ; hou ze 
i 've just read a web friend 's posting in " awe - inspiring righteousness - - mr. li guiren " 
his ( her ) original words were " negotiation and compromise are key tools of democracy . otherwise , divisions due to differences of opinion result in the failure of democracy ! ! ! it is hoped that idealistic democracy advocates will pay close attention to this point ! " 
that this prosaic and colorless statement did not attract the interest of any web friends stired a succession of thoughts in my mind and filled me with regret . 
i think about china 's antiquity . i also think about the past in the west . 
i , who have started very few threads , could not resist using a new thread to respond to the posting by the original net friend . 
let 's $number take a look at antiquity in china . 
everybody knows that in china , starting with the united centralized rule built by qin shi huang , all subsequent dynasties operated according to this political framework . 
although the han dynasty temporarily implemented a " dual system " ; that is , political system in which feudalism and centralism operated in parallel ; it finally ended up employing centralism . 
under the historical conditions of that time , this kind of centralism had facets that were advanced or that promoted productivity and development . 
but we should also observe that $number years of this kind of system resulted in localities that lacked the creativity , initiative and motivation that they should have . furthermore , it was impossible to tailor - make systems and policies so that they suited local development . 
a pyramid - shaped system of political rule also made it so that lower - level officials could only fix their gazes upward and in every regard take orders from their immediate superiors . 
because the local county officials were all appointed by the central government , there was no room for coordination or negotiation between them , let alone with the common people . 
when the rights of peasants in ancient china were infringed upon , they could only grin and bear it . 
it was only when their most basic rights were threatened , such as by large scale famine , or when their right to life was being deprived due to tyranny or natural calamity , that they would rise in rebellion . 
in $number years , several turbulent peasant uprisings have swept across the entire country : from the unplanned chen sheng and wu guang uprising to the preplanned yellow turban rebellion , and then to the huang chao rebellion in the tang dynasty and li zicheng , who was able to rule as emperor for a month as the result of an uprising . besides zhu yuanzhang , none of the rebellions obtained a truly meaningful victory . 
even the ming dynasty that zhu yuanzhang initiated was nothing more than the reincarnation of previous dynasties , with no change in political institutions . 
zhu yuanzhang , born a commoner and uncultured for the most part , manipulated china 's ancient centralized system with a perverse relish , taking it to its extreme limits . the vigor of the tang dynasty , characterized by openness , freedom and tolerance , was lost and replaced by a deathly spiritlessness . 
all at once , the atmosphere of free speech disappeared from china 's vast area . 
human nature was suppressed to the highest degree . 
people became timorous , extremely afraid , and unwilling to say too much . 
this was the outcome of the only peasant uprising to succeed in $number years : in one go it turned the chinese people into the living dead . 
now let 's look at western europe 's medieval period , which has been called the dark ages . 
the middle ages in western europe was $number year period that occurred after nomadic peoples destroyed western rome and that did not have the slightest connection to ancient greece and ancient rome . 
this period was characterized by feudalism ; that is , the granting of feudal land titles . 
as titles were subdivided into increasingly lower strata , the lords at each lower stratum possessed an increased amount of autonomy . 
because they were capable of balancing , restricting and depending on each other both vertically and horizontally , even feudal lords with a few square kilometers of land as well as the dukes , marquises , earls , viscounts and barons that came to power possessed the conditions and clout to win from the king the rights that were rightfully theirs , thereby producing a situation where aristocrats and the king sat together to negotiate for their respective benefit , a situation that has ne 
that is , mutual accommodation and concession , and not the use of violent methods to beat down and replace the other party . 
in this way , with the drawing up various agreements , power steadily moved down into the hands of aristocrats and commoners . the power of the aristocrats and commoners gradually increased while the king 's power progressively decreased . 
by the time the queen of england came along , she only occupied a passive position and did not have any real power . 
this is how democracy was gradually achieved ! 
let 's take another look back in order to make a comparison . in ancient china , with all power concentrated in the hand of the emperor ( with the exception of li shimin ) and almost no aristocracy , it was almost impossible for peasants to sit with the emperor over a pot of tea or a glass of wine and light - heartedly make mutual compromises and concessions or formulate agreements that satisfied both sides . 
under such circumstances , when they were being deprived of their right to life , they had no choice but to adopt violent methods to overthrow the current dynasty in an attempt to supplant it . 
this outcome repeated itself again and again , from the high point of the tang dynasty to the morbidity of the ming dynasty . 
if we compare european and chinese history , we discover that there is practically no western country with an ancient period where the contradictions between the rulers and the ruled were as sharp as in china . 
there is no western country that experienced an endless succession of peasant uprisings like china did . 
when contradictions arose between the royal house and the peasants in the ancient history of western countries , $number thing that aristocrats and commoners thought of when they were making an appeal for their own interests was to reach a solution through negotiation and make mutual concessions in order to gradually obtain greater benefits . rarely did they employ violent methods . 
understanding this , as we enter $date , we can still see on the internet that there are some democracy militants who , having inherited the ultra - absolute totalitarian thinking of the ming dynasty , 
and whose bodies have been invaded by the poison of the cultural revolution , are incapable as democratic warriors of talking about anything but " overthrow " and " toppling " . 
but this kind of thinking is the greatest barrier to democracy , because these people do not understand that negotiation and cooperation are the most important means and channel to realizing democracy . 
& lt ; headline & gt ; cao xiaoming - - rich cultural activities in the countryside : who will " pay the bill " ? 
& lt ; poster & gt ; hou ze 
during this year 's spring festival , i was fortunate enough to spend the new year in the countryside visiting some family and friends . 
while being caught up in the rich new year 's atmosphere in china 's countryside , i also became worried about the lack of interesting cultural activities in rural areas . 
i discovered in a friend 's village that in past years the village would set out on its own each spring festival to organize the villagers in putting on a local play called " the galloping horse lantern " . 
the play takes as its subject the characters from the three kingdoms . adults and children can all enact a role in the play . the villagers never tire of watching . 
in this way , there are several " galloping horse lantern " performance troupes throughout the county . they perform not only in their own village , but also travel to other villages , with the exchange between villages becoming very lively . 
but this year the village did not organize a troupe . 
, it seems that it took a lot of money just to buy the costumes for " the galloping horse lantern " . in the past , the villagers would each contribute some cash , but now the costumes are tattered to the point that they can no longer be worn . 
a house - to - house appeal was made to the villagers to again fork out money , but none was willing . a similar situation has arisen in other villages throughout the county . 
without the " galloping horse lantern " , the village has suddenly become cold and cheerless . 
the adults have started playing mahjong . 
the children have also started playing cards . 
the villagers all say that this new year 's was dull . 
other than setting off firecrackers , everybody just played mahjong and that became the general backdrop of chinese new year in the countryside . 
in addition , repeated bans have failed to halt a gambling craze that is showing a tendency to spread . games involving upwards of $number yuan have become a common occurrence , with the large number of returning migrant workers playing a particularly important role in many games . 
in this way , money earned from a year of hard work is squandered . 
also , family squabbles stemming from gambling sometimes occur . some even descend into tragedies where families are split or life is lost . 
some farmers say that they gamble not only during the spring festival , but also often during the slack season . 
if they don 't gamble , they don 't have anywhere to go . 
in the countryside , it is too difficult to organize cultural activities or find entertainment . 
not only is there a lack of facilities and funds , but also nobody volunteers to handle the organization . 
in this respect , the method used in jiangxi is doubtlessly welcome news for rural dwellers . 
in order to enrich the cultural life of the rural population , the jiangxi provincial government has not only implemented as of $date last year a program of " government funding , market operation , town construction of stages and villagers watching plays " , 
but also organizes each year a special fund of at least rmb60 million for rural cultural projects in order to provide the rural population high quality cultural products . 
with the new year , it added an additional rmb40 million , making a rural cultural project fund totaling rmb100 million . 
for the rural population , the fruits of this special fund are also very substantial : 
they invite various types of professional performance troupes to come to the villages to perform . each village cannot have less than four performances each year . 
they invite screening teams from different levels of movie companies and organizations to come to the villages to show movies . each administrative village cannot have less than six screenings of entertainment and educational films each year . 
they organize and hold popular cultural events that have local character . each village cannot have less than two or three each year . 
from this " purchase list " , we can easily see that the government has not thrown money at the problem , but rather has expended a lot of energy to use limited funds in an incisive way in order to deliver a cultural feast with good value to the vast rural population . they have performed an important task . 
now , not an individual among the vast rural population is not ecstatic about the waiver of the grain tax . 
if governments could do like jiangxi and make greater " purchases " to enrich the cultural life of the rural population , it would be another gift from heaven for those living in the countryside , 
and this " gift " would not only free the farmers from the mahjong table , the movement in cultural activities would also add another brick in socialist construction of a new countryside .

kidnap warning for wang peirong 's child was a false alarm 
after $time on the evening of $date , the child of wang peirong finished relating the following : 
while making up classes in physics at xuzhou 's no. $number middle school on the morning of $date , wang peirong 's child was called out by the entrance guard . 
the entrance guard informed wang peirong 's child that three unidentified men had said the following to the entrance guards of no. $number middle school : wang peirong 's child , wang tianjiao , has not returned home for three days because the father and mother of wang peirong 's child are not getting along . 
now her mother is missing . we are leaders from her mother 's work unit and want to enter no. $number middle school to get wang peirong 's child . 
wang peirong 's child told the entrance guards that what the three men had said was completely untrue and she refused to go with the three men . 
with the help of the entrance guards of no. $number middle school , wang peirong 's child was not taken away . 
wang peirong 's child phoned her mother 's leader at noon to find out what was going on . the leader denied sending anybody to xuzhou 's no. $number middle school . 
wang peirong 's child asked her for the phone number of her father 's leader . 
wang peirong 's child called her father 's leader . 
wang peirong 's child said : three people came to no. $number middle school to take me away . 
the leader asked : why didn 't you go with them ? 
wang peirong 's child answered : if i had gone with them i would be dead for sure . 
when she had finished speaking , wang peirong 's child hung up the phone . 
hearing a description of the events from his child , wang peirong felt that the situation was serious and reported it to the police . 
on $date , the local police station received feedback that the story told by wang peirong 's child was essentially true . 
the police station asked the kuangda security department if they had sent people to the no. $number middle school to get wang peirong 's child . they responded that they hadn 't . 
the police station again asked the kuangda security department if any of its branch units had sent people to no. $number middle school to get wang peirong 's child . they again answered that they hadn 't . 
through them , the relevant departments warned wang peirong and his family to pay attention to their safety . 
following the event , the leaders of the relevant departments of xuzhou municipality paid close attention . 
the criminal investigation department of the xuzhou public security bureau excluded the possibility of a kidnap attempt against the child . 
wang peirong thanked the relevant department heads of the xuzhou municipality and the criminal investigation department of xuzhou public security department . 
it was a false alarm . the main cause of the false alarm was possibly the entrance guards of no. $number middle school . 
the criminal investigation department of the xuzhou public security bureau has learned : on $date , the leader of the college of science , which is wang peirong 's work unit , and three other individuals urgently needed to find wang peirong ( wang peirong still does not know why they were looking for him ) and could not find him by telephone . they thought of going to no. $number middle school to find the teacher of wang peirong 's child in order to ask if wang peirong 's child was still in 
a weighty topic : why is the risk involved in corruption relatively low while the cost of fighting corruption is high ? 
http://bbs.people.com.cn/bbs/readfile?whichfile=44796&amp;typeid=39 
under the present cadre system and anti - corruption system , what corrupt officials need to be worry about is a few relevant officials overseeing them , not the broad masses of people . 
therefore , once they feel that they have successfully hoodwinked or contented those few officials that can determine their fate , they can they feel reassured and unafraid as they carry out their great project of corruptly and illegally collecting wealth while disregarding the feelings of the nearby masses of people . 
on the contrary , if the common people who don 't hold any power come across an injustice and stand up against corruption , they will possibly provoke an extremely brutal reprisal , 
or be branded by the government and end up at any time being crushed in defeat before obtaining any victory . 
a comparison of the two : engaging in corruption is relatively risk free , while the cost of resisting corruption on the other hand is high .

traces of bird flu appear in europe four times , people in nigeria in state of anxiety 
from brussels on the $number , afp 
traces of the bird flu have continuously been appearing in europe , creating fear and trepidation among the people . 
the eu executive committee , by bringing all areas of countries in which the virus was discovered under management and prohibiting all fowl from being traded and transported , has once again established a " buffer area " management system . 
the $number day after discovering the deadly h5n1 virus in the african country of nigeria saw the epidemic continually spread to more chicken farms ; the indicators show that it has already jumped across the northern border and entered niger . 
an egyptian official is currently investigating a southern chicken farm that saw groupings of sudden deaths ; they worry that the virus will likely continue to spread .

now let 's take a look at the iranian nuclear issue . 
the international atomic energy agency verified on the $number that the iranian government had sent a letter to the international atomic energy agency demanding that it dismantle and remove all equipment monitoring iran 's nuclear facilities by the middle of this month . 
because the international atomic energy agency decided to report the iran nuclear issue to the united nations security council , iran has announced the termination of all support and cooperation measures it had adopted with respect to the nuclear issue , and it will not longer permit the international atomic energy agency to perform surprise inspections of its nuclear facilities . 
targeting the current tense situation with respect to the iranian nuclear issue , russian foreign minister lavrov said on the $number in athens that the cooperation between russia and iran still exists . 
this will become the driving force in the resolution of the iran nuclear issue . 
on the same day , a spokesperson for the russian ministry of foreign affairs said that russia 's proposal to iran to establish a joint uranium enrichment enterprise within russia 's borders was still effective . 
the two parties could engage in negotiations concerning this issue next week . 
on the same day , at united nations headquarters in new york , senator lugar , chairman of the united states senate foreign relations committee , said that the united states does not approve of israeli attacks of iran 's nuclear facilities . 
according to recent reports , israeli defense experts have said that , if necessary , israel could severely damage iran 's nuclear facilities . 
xinhua news agency reports that on the $number , russian deputy foreign minister kislyak said russia is willing to cooperate with iran regarding the nuclear issue and help iran obtain the legal authority to peacefully develop nuclear energy . 
kislyak said that russia 's proposal to iran to establish a joint uranium enrichment enterprise with iran remains valid . 
russia hopes to hold negotiations with iran concerning this issue in the near future . 
at the end of $date last year , russia submitted a proposal to iran that the two countries establish a joint uranium enrichment enterprise within russia 's borders . 
the european union and the united states both said that they could accept this compromise proposal . 
but iran hopes russia will continue to revise the original plan . 
on the $number , chinese ministry of foreign affairs spokesperson kong quan said that although the international atomic energy agency had reported the iran atomic energy problem to the united nations security council , it had not transferred the agency 's responsibility to handle the iranian nuclear issue to the security council . 
therefore , the various parties must still break the deadlock over the iran nuclear issue within the framework of the international atomic energy agency . 
according to a resolution of the international atomic energy agency , international atomic energy agency general director baradei will deliver a report concerning the iran nuclear issue to the security council in $date . 
after evaluating this report , the security council will make a final decision . 
we feel that this resolution mentions requiring iran to , uh , fulfill the relevant security council resolutions and the promises it has made , and has not submitted or transferred this problem to the security council . 
for some time recently , china has sought a peaceful resolution to the iran nuclear issue through diplomatic means . 
kong quan said that on $date , zhang yan , director - general of the chinese ministry of foreign affairs department of arms control and disarmament , held talks in tehran concerning the iran nuclear issue with lalijiani , negotiating representative of the secretariat of the supreme security council of iran . 
the chinese hope iran will attach importance to the international community as the key to creating conditions for a peaceful resolution of the iranian nuclear issue . 
resolution of the iranian nuclear issue within the iaea framework is not only in china 's interests ; moreover , we firmly believe that it is in the interests of all parties . 
to this end , we once again call on the concerned parties in the international community to not abandon the diplomatic efforts made regarding this issue . 
hamas , which is currently in the process of forming the new palestinian self - rule government , has announced that , with the exception of the prime minister , the nominees for the new government 's cabinet are essentially in place . 
this has triggered all manner of speculation among outsiders concerning the selection of the prime minister . 
on the $number , a senior hamas official disclosed to the associated press that hamas was prepared to nominate ( ( businessman ) ) khudari , chairman of the board of trustees of islamic university in gaza , but this nomination has yet to be formally submitted to abbas . 
with the support of hamas , khudari , who is now $number , participated in palestine 's parliamentary election last month as an independent candidate . 
khudari has never mentioned violence or opposition to israel in his public speeches . 
but he has said that palestine must engage in internal reform . 
a high - level hamas delegation is currently visiting cairo to discuss the issue of hamas ' formation of the new palestinian authority government . 
on the $number , khaled masha 'al , a member of the delegation , told the press that despite the constant pressure from the international community and certain arab countries , the palestinian government formed by hamas leaders would not recognize israel . 
at the same time , masha 'al warned abbas in his statement : do not arbitrarily change the structure of palestinian leadership without consulting hamas in advance . 
analysts believe that this was in response to abbas ' plan to appoint interior minister yousef as deputy commander of security forces . 
and concerning the issue of the formation of a new palestinian self - rule government , masha 'al declined to verify the news that hamas was preparing to nominate ( ( businessman ) ) khudari , chairman of the board of trustees of islamic university in gaza to serve as the prime minister . 
masha 'al said , " the nominee for prime minister has yet to be determined . " 
prior to masha 'al 's reiteration of the refusal to recognize israel , in an egyptian television interview , ma 'erzuke , another hamas political leader , said , " hamas will absolutely not recognize the legal status of israel , but the new government will continue have contacts with israel in a variety of areas . because whether or not one recognizes israel and whether or not one has dealings with it are two different matters . " 
setting aside the new animosity and old grudges toward israel of the three hamas nominees for prime minister , territorial issues have always been a sticking point in palestinian - israeli relations . 
in an interview with israeli television channel $number on the $number , ehud olmert , acting prime minister of israel , said that israel must be separated from palestine through the delineation of a permanent border .

uh , now , their work unit , uh , in the last two days , the chairman of the labor union of the cement institute over here , uh , has established a consolation team , which has continually been doing consolation work in the homes of the victims . 
as for the specific compensation figure , we still have no definite , certain answer . 
uh , we do know that one of the insurance items is $number in accidental injury insurance . 
uh , the families have yet to contact insurance companies directly concerning claims ; rather , the work unit has stepped forward to make inquiries with the claims processing company and the , uh , insurance company concerning the processing of claims . 
uh , this is the situation as i understand it at present . 
all right , thank you , li guangyu , for your onsite report . 
additionally , yuan fengning , xue jijun and yang wei , who were fortunate to survive the terrorist attack on $date , and other personnel from the hefei cement research and design institute who were stationed in balochistan , pakistan , returned by plane to hefei .

concerned parties explained that claims processing for the three victims and consolation of their families were in process . 
though the bodies of the three murdered chinese engineers have returned to their mother country , the investigation into the attack continues in pakistan . 
just one hour ago , at $time beijing time , pakistani police met with chinese consular staff in pakistan and reported the progress of the investigation to the chinese . 
now let 's connect with our correspondent in pakistan , tao ye . 
hello , tao ye . 
hey , hello . 
yes . 
in the meeting just now , through - - 
( ( ) ) 
in the information meeting just now , what progress in the investigation was reported ? 
ah , all right . 
just as you 've said , only an hour ago , the chief of police in balochistan , the province where the place where the incident occurred is located , by the name of yakubu , came to china 's consulate general in karachi to report on the investigation into this affair by pakistani police in the last two days to china 's ambassador and consul general . 
in his report , he briefly introduced the current clues and objectives of the , uh , pakistani police in pursuing the primary culprits . 
uh , they firmly believe that this matter was done by outsiders , but they are certain that they had contacts with some local residents . 
so , they are now focusing on , uh , uh , certain employees who had employment relationships with the company where the chinese engineers worked . 
they believe these people could have provided , uh , some clues , provided some intelligence for the culprits , intelligence including , for example , what time the chinese engineers departed and what time they arrived in what places . 
they may have also provided cover for these culprits . 
so these , uh , aspects are the focus of the current police investigation . 
according to this chief of police , he said that after two days of investigations , they had interrogated $number people . 
the scope of this investigation is currently shrinking . 
also , um , when the chinese information meeting ended , this chief of police and his police officers also , also went into the mourning hall set up in the karachi consulate general to pay their respects to the , uh , three deceased . 
uh , additionally , um , another thing that was relatively interesting was that a balochistan liberation army that had always claimed to exist in the past ( ( ) ) responsibility for this matter , but this news has yet to be verified by pakistani officials . 
uh , when answering the questions of this station 's reporter concerning this matter , that chief of police said that this , uh , terrorist organization in fact is a very loose terrorist group with no definite integral organization . 
so , uh , he many many people claim to be members of this organization . 
uh , therefore , uh , from the pakistani perspective , they , uh , are still laying the focus of the investigation on many specific individuals . 
as for this organization , they do not view it as a major key , uh , uh , aspect . 
all right . 
all right , tao ye . 
( ( ) ) 
mm , we will continue to keep an eye on the related investigation situation . 
thank you , tao ye , for your onsite report . 
danish prime minister rasmussen held a press conference at the prime minister 's office on tuesday . 
he said , " the incident of the cartoons of islam founder mohammed has developed to the current state where extremists are exploiting it . " 
he ( ( claimed ) ) that denmark respects all beliefs , and he appealed that everyone has the same rights , uh , while also calling on muslims to exercise restraint and not resort to violence . 
danish prime minister rasmussen and the foreign minister held a press conference in the prime minister 's office at $time on the $number . 
rasmussen said . 
the incidents of violence that have occurred at the embassies of these european countries are not merely a matter between muslim countries and denmark . 
it is extremely important to the danish government and the danish people to obtain the broad support of the international community to pass through this difficulty . 
we have formed an alliance with france . 
some organizations and institutions in muslim countries belonging to other european countries and the united states are cooperating closely . 
several minutes ago , u.s. president bush telephoned . 
during the telephone conversation , he expressed support for denmark and consensus with denmark . 
rasmussen said , " we also feel that the matter will be resolved through dialogue and tolerance , not violence . " 
we emphasize that freedom and democracy and respect for beliefs are treasured values . 
today we call on the people in all muslim countries to cooperate to end the expansion of the violence . 
we must resolve the matter through dialogue , not violence . 
today we are facing an expanded international situation . 
we have seen the burning of the danish flag and the destruction of its embassies . 
we see danish people being seen as intolerant people , being seen as enemies of islam . 
this is wrong . 
extremists and radicals are exploiting cultural conflict to expand the situation . 
rasmussen emphasized , " denmark and we danes are not the enemies of islam or other religions . " 
for many generations has denmark transcended politics in pursuit of human rights , democracy and freedom . 
we continue to struggle for this . 
this is part of denmark 's history , and is an essential component of danish society . 
denmark is one of the most tolerant and open countries in the world . 
we respect all beliefs . 
we resist violence . 
we believe that everyone has equal rights . 
new tang dynasty reporters li luo and dan ni , reporting from copenhagen , denmark . 
iranian extremists dissatisfied with the publication of cartoons of mohammed once again charged the danish embassy in tehran on tuesday , lobbing molotov cocktails at it . 
at the same time , in revenge , a state newspaper in iran sponsored a contest of cartoons depicting the nazi slaughter of jews . 
the united states condemned this move as an arrogant means of intensifying iranian president ahmadinejad 's persistent anti - israeli sentiment . 
approximately $number protesters climbed over the wall into the courtyard of denmark 's embassy in iran . 
and $number people outside the embassy threw rocks and molotov cocktails at the building . 
the previous day , student members of an iranian hardline paramilitary organization led $number protesters in an attack on the embassies of denmark and austria in tehran . 
the cartoons that triggered the dispute were $number published last $date by denmark 's jyllands - posten . 
other european countries and three arabic newspapers also carried them subsequently . 
in retaliation , hamshahri , iran 's most widely distributed newspaper , recently announced that it was sponsoring a contest of cartoons depicting the nazi slaughter of the jews . 
this move was sharply denounced by the united states and other countries . 
united states department of state spokesperson mccormack said that this move by iran 's best - selling hamshahri was in order to strengthen the virulent anti - israeli sentiment espoused by president ahmadinejad . 
mccormack reiterated that the united states supports freedom of speech everywhere throughout the world , including iran . 
but he believes that hamshahri 's cartoon contest and the cartoons of mohammed published in the danish media are two entirely separate matters . 
mccormack said , " i do not believe anyone would mention freedom of the press in iran and freedom of the press in western europe and the united states in the same breath . " 
ahmadinejad once said that the slaughter of the jews was a fiction , and called for israel to be wiped off the map , attracting broad criticism from the united states and other countries . 
mccormack believes that hamshahri is owned and published by the conservative municipal government of tehran . 
the current sponsorship of the cartoon contest is by no means coincidental .

immediately following the international atomic energy agency 's decision to hand the iran nuclear issue over to the united nations security council , iran reiterated that there is no room for negotiations with the united states , one of the proponents . 
uh , an iranian government spokesperson said on monday that the policy toward the united states implemented to date has been not to discuss or negotiate its relationship with the opposing party . 
he said that it was a major mistake for the west to hand the nuclear issue over to the security council , demonstrating the west 's obstruction of iran 's development . 
on sunday , iran said that it was suspending cooperation with the international atomic energy agency , and would resume uranium extraction and enrichment and prohibit surprise inspections of nuclear facilities . 
so with respect to this issue , iran 's current attitude is relatively unyielding , and the attitude of the united states is even more unyielding . 
uh , american secretary of defense rumsfeld has already reasserted multiple times that the use of military force has not been ruled out with respect to this problem . 
uh , now it is rumored that the u.s. military is really in the process of implementing such a plan . 
they are developing a kind of superhuge bomb called the mother of bombs . 
uh , once the defense department orders it , they will use this superhuge , uh , bomb to bomb iran . 
so how big a bomb is this mother of bombs ? 
according to reports , just in terms of weight , it is $number pounds , equivalent to a double decker bus , and , uh , it is also extremely large in volume . 
uh , the development of such a super bomb is primarily in order to bomb certain , uh , underground facilities in iran . 
because of its extremely strong penetration force - - it can pass through concrete as well as steel plates - - it is likely to create a large pit equivalent to $number meters long half a mile , destroying many such , uh , underground structures and facilities . 
so now it appears that the united states has truly begun provisionally polishing its guns or provisionally making bombs . 
regarding this issue , rumsfeld says that no means have been ruled out to resolve the iran nuclear issue , and military means had already been placed on the table . 
also , the iran nuclear issue is continually upgrading , so , uh , when interviewed by this station , a concerned iranian official stationed in washington said that in fact , iran continued to uphold the adoption of peaceful negotiations to cooperate with international society , and , uh , they hoped to alleviate the crisis . 
but he also said that iran would adjust the contents of its nuclear project in cooperation with russia . 
regarding $number round of negotiations between iran and russia concerning the uranium enrichment project , iran said that the negotiations would proceed as originally planned , but it emphasized that the changes occurring in the current situation made it necessary to make some adjustments to the content of negotiations . 
previously , russia had always expressed support for iran 's peaceful use of nuclear power , and it had expressed that it would insist on not submitting the iran nuclear issue to the security council . 
however , now we see that they have already approved the submission of the iran nuclear issue to the u. n. security council . 
with this new situation , we therefore may make some changes to the policies arrived at previously with russia . 
and , prior to the u. n. security council 's final decision as to whether or not to adopt economic and political sanctions in $date , iran has advocated continuous negotiations with international agencies , and it is willing to cooperate with the international community , thereby alleviating the current crisis . 
we emphasize , in order to fight for our own economic development and national construction , iran will not relinquish the right to peaceful use of nuclear energy . 
iran has not violated relevant international laws . we hope that the united states can also understand this . 
the iran nuclear issue is completely different from the problems in afghanistan and iraq . 
i think the united states is also very clear on this point . 
as for so - called military attacks , we have not seen any clear statement of position from the united states . 
we do not wish to see the crisis escalate further . 
we also emphasize that we want to use peaceful negotiating methods , but we will not submit to pressure . 
additionally , ( ( agabi ) ) also said that he hoped china continue to maintain cooperation with china based on the preservation of its original stance .

like delta airlines , delta airlines has announced that all flights in washington , as well as philadelphia , baltimore and connecticut have been grounded until monday . 
at present , reagan airport in washington , dc is already open . 
at present , buses have suspended operation in the new york and new jersey region . 
and scheduled bus and train service has been reduced . 
now we are at , uh , it is currently sunday in new york , still the lantern festival . 
to us chinese , the lantern festival , originally , some local chinese communities had lantern festival activities , but they were forced to cancel them . 
as to the people of new york , generally speaking , their sunday activities were also canceled . uh , not many people are going out , they are all staying at home . 
yes . 
what 's troubling everyone now is what to do about work on monday ? 
uh , snow removal and , uh , accumulated snow could result in some flooding . 
therefore , the governments of these , uh , affected areas in the united states are studying how to face the floods of people and cars going to work on monday . 
xiaonan . 
all right . 
thank you , xiaoying , for giving us the latest report from the united states . 
since there 's nothing to be done about it , one might as well rest easy and appreciate this , uh , very beautiful snowscape . 
let 's have a look at several news items concerning japan . 
er , koizumi has always wanted to upgrade japan 's defense agency to a ministry , in order to increase japan 's military strength . 
but great controversy has been stirred up during this process , which has met with one snag after another . 
recently , scandals have arisen when japan 's defense facilities administration agency , which is subordinate to the defense agency , placed requests for bids , uh , requests for construction bids , resulting in arrests by authorities of certain current and former officials . 
therefore , many people have recommended that koizumi exercise caution in the process of upgrading the agency to a ministry . 
well , recently , koizumi said that he was temporarily shelving this plan , that for the time being he would not be submitting it to the diet for deliberation . 
uh , he also hopes that the two ruling parites are able to discuss this issue carefully in order to , er , continue exchanging views . 
in other news , if you go to japan , there is now a new requirement . 
japan plans to require the majority of tourists and travelers visiting japan to be fingerprinted and photographed . 
it is doing so in order to prevent certain unsafe elements from entering japan . it is also intended to prevent , uh , illegal immigration . 
er , so now , it should be a little more difficult to go to japan . 
well , of course , japan also had a bit of happy news recently . 
princess kiko of japan is expecting . 
this matter has made many japanese naturally hope that she will bear a son to succeed to the throne . 
however , she has also made waves in the imperial household , which has always been relatively calm . 
uh , in fact , kiko of course is now a later - age expectant mother , and everyone always thought she was satisfied with her family of four . 
with her becoming pregnant again at this age , many people could not help but guess that , uh , a struggle for the throne could be playing out between the brothers of the royal family . 
of course , many people are delighted to talk about this conspiracy theory . 
to explain this matter may require going back several years . 
uh , it was like this : at the time , in ' $number , because crown prince naruhito , uh , his wife , became depressed , the royal family did not hold out much hope for them at the time , so they turned to exerting pressure on prince akishino . 
at that time , there was not much response from akishino . 
but $date , the contradiction intensified somewhat , because naruhito , eager to protect his wife , blamed the royal family in public . 
well , according to reports , the royal family was infuriated , and demanded that prince akishino , who is of the same generation , step forward to make a rebuttal , saying that his elder brother had been disrespectful to the royal family , and was doting on his wife . 
from then on , there has been discord between the brothers . 
so now , if , uh , prince akishino bears a son , then their , uh , main axis will become a pillar of the , uh , royal family . 
and that will assuredly cause a decline of the eastern palace , that is , the crown prince . 
uh , so a good many people believe that if this happens , it will have a great impact on the royal family and japanese society . 
united nations secretary general annan went to the white house monday to meet with american president bush . 
regarding iran 's announced postponement of nuclear negotiations with russia , annan urged iran to cease nuclear activities as quickly as possible , and to resolve problems through negotiations rather than confrontation . 
another news item indicates that the u.s. department of defense has already begun plans for intensive bombing of iran , to serve as the ultimate backup plan if diplomatic efforts fail . 
originally , outsiders thought that bush and annan would discuss the possibility of un security council sanctions against iran , but the two did not announce discussions in this regard after their meeting . 
bush and annan both emphasized that they hoped the iranian nuclear issue would be resolved through negotiations . 
annan expressed concerns over iran 's commencement of uranium enrichment activities and its decision to postpone nuclear negotiations with russia . 
on the same day , the u.s. media reported that military strategists at the pentagon had already begun intensive planning of military actions to be adopted with respect to iran ; in the event that diplomatic efforts fail , the u.s. will use military means to halt iran 's development of nuclear weapons . 
according to reports , the commander of the u.s. central command is in the process of determining attack targets . 
attack methods could include submarine - launched ballistic missles and air strikes by b-2 bombers . 
on monday , annan called on all parties not to adopt actions that would escalate the crisis . 
according to analysis by military experts , iran could have the ability to produce nuclear weapons within two years . 
and there are still more than two years remaining in bush 's $number term . 
he will strive to resolve the iran nuclear issue during his term , whether by peaceful or military means . 
mo naiqian , phoenix satellite news , reporting from washington . 
on the $number , iranian president ahmadinejad said superpowers that threaten other countries with their own weapons were about to disappear . 
while commemorating the $number anniversary of the islamic revolution , ahmadinejad met with diplomatic envoys of various countries . 
he said that the arms contests and competitions in the scramble for hegemony among various countries in the world would not yield results . 
the appetites of superpowers can never be satisfied . they even threaten other countries with their weapons . 
but he said these superpowers who rely on weapons to threaten other countries would disappear . 
the day when mankind enjoys permanent peace and stability is about to arrive . 
thus it can be seen that this is now not merely , um , a war of words , but really and truly , um , this kind of saber rattling between iran and the western world and america is now getting worse and worse . 
so , because the , uh , attitudes between iraq and the united states are mutually unyielding , recently , the situation has changed somewhat ; the day before yesterday , iran formally announced that it was resuming its plans to extract and enrich uranium . 
in fact , some western diplomats surmised that they may very well have actually resumed certain processes in uranium extraction and enrichment prior to this . 
additionally , iran announced that it was postponing negotiations with russia indefinitely ; the negotiations concerned russia extracting and enriching uranium instead of iran . 
so of course the indefinite postponement of this negotiation plan was also determined with respect to the current , new situation . 
uh , recently , because the united states , uh , has continued its threats to attack iran , a u. k. think tank , the oxford institute , has issued a report . 
if the united states actually adopts military force , it will result in the death of half of the people , and of course it will trigger , uh , the possible continuation of this year 's , uh , wave of violence in the middle east . 
also , some , uh , terrorist attacks will also worsen . 
of course , oil prices will also rise sharply . this is also among the , uh , this series of domino effects . 
moreover , the report also says that if the united states is unable to make iran submit , it will certainly accelerate iran 's determination to produce nuclear weapons itself . 
so , we have just mentioned the issue of negotiations between russia and iran . 
an iranian government spokesperson indeed indicated on monday that due to the emergence of the new situation , the negotiations with russian officials concerning the extraction and enrichment of uranium inside russia originally set for the $number would be postponed . 
a russian ministry of foreign affairs spokesperson said that they had not received formal notification from iran . 
so it is currently still too early to say whether the meeting will go on . 
additionally , on monday , uh , the head of russia 's federal international atomic energy agency , guqinuofu , said that the russians had already prepared the conditions and principles for negotiations with iran concerning the nuclear issue . 
at the same time , the new york times of the united states recently published an editorial . 
and the title of this editorial was extremely striking : japan 's offensive foreign minister . 
so , this editorial , uh , specifically mentions that taro aso , the japanese foreign minister , has made a series of astonishing statements recently . 
these statements are all extremely dishonest , extremely unwise , and these statements have been met with the universal indignation of asian countries . 
well , uh , the editorial also specifically mentions that japan , uh , should acknowledge its own mistakes and assimilate lessons , unlike what it is doing now - - post - war educational materials avoiding mention of the things they did during the war . 
at the same time , this editorial also says that many of taro aso 's current statements , such as demanding that the , uh , prime minister visit the yasukuni shrine , such as , uh , colonial rule over taiwan raised , ah , uh , japan 's colonial rule raised the education level of taiwan , etc. - - it astonishes people when he makes such statements , and , very clearly , he has no knowledge of history , and his diplomacy skills are terrible . 
well , the new york times had $number largest distribution in the united states last year , so it should be very influential in the united states . 
therefore , this editorial should also be very influential . 
at the same time , a seminar was held recently by certain former high officials of the u.s. government and certain experts specializing in the study of asian affairs - - a seminar on sino - japanese relations . 
well , some experts raised the following viewpoint at the seminar . 
they said that sino - japanese relations are currently in a period of extreme tension , and that there is a potential risk of military conflict . 
moreover , they even said that the possibility that a military conflict could erupt between china and japan was higher than the possibility that a military conflict could erupt across the taiwan strait . 
er , and once a military conflict erupts , the united states is certain to be dragged in , because the u.s. would certainly become involved . 
well , a spokesperson for japan 's ministry of foreign affairs who also participated in the seminar said that sino - japanese relations are indeed in an extremely tense phase at present . 
um , any mistakes could result in severe consequences . 
additionally , the defense and security committee of georgia 's parliament held an extended session and decided to expel , uh , the russian peacekeeping forces in the south ossetia region . 
a general meeting of the russian parliament will convene today for deliberations on this proposal . 
er , experts believe that if the parliament approves the expulsion of russian peacekeeping forces , it could result in a complete rupture in relations between georgia and russia . 
on the $number , a spokesperson for the russian peacekeeping forces said that two of the russian peacekeeping force 's military vehicles transporting food were intercepted by georgian police , and that the drivers had been run off . 
er , the spokesperson then demanded that georgian authorites immediately cease such provocative activity , otherwise russia would not accept responsibility for the consequences of the incident . 
on monday evening , two military vehicles belonging to the russian peacekeeping force logistics system that were transporting grain and non - staple foodstuffs encountered an inspection by georgian police in the south ossetia region . 
the georgian police officers on duty ran the russian drivers and escort personnel off and took the two vehicles by force and drove off in them . 
the incident raised resentment among the russian peacekeeping force . 
a spokesperson for the russian peacekeeping forces claims that on $date , georgian police detained a russian military vehicle in the same area , giving a traffic accident as the reason , and have yet to return the vehicle . 
on $date , they detained three russian officers for two days and nights under the pretext of visa problems . 
georgia 's intentional acts of provocation are in the hopes that a sanguinary incident will occur in the region , forcing russian troops to open fire , in order to achieve the objective of withdrawal of the peacekeeping forces . 
on the same day , the russian embassy in georgia took up the matter formally with georgian authorities , demanding that georgia cease such frenzied provocation immediately , otherwise russia would not assume responsibility for the consequences of resulting conflicts . 
media indicated that on $date , georgian defense minister irakli okruashivili announced that leaders of the russian military base in akhalkalaki had sold several guided missiles used by the " arrow " type portable guided missile system to south ossetia . 
on the same day , the georgian parliament 's national defense and security committee held an extended session , heard reports from force ministries , and decided to expel russian peacekeeping forces stationed within georgia 's borders , requesting deliberation of this issue at the general meeting of parliament on the $number . 
experts believe that once the final decision passes , it could lead to a final and total rupture in relations between georgia and russia . 
prior to this , georgian foreign minister gela bezhuashvili harshly criticized the russian position and rejected russian president vladimir putin 's statement that if the west acknowledged kosovo , russia could acknowledge abkhazia and south ossetia , believing that russia was sending a signal of encouragement to all separatist regions . 
russia 's ministry of foreign affairs has also claimed previously that it will protect russian citizens in south ossetia , implying the threat of direct military force against georgia . 
lu yuguang , phoenix satellite news , reporting from moscow . 
admiral gary roughead , commander in chief of the united states pacific fleet , announced tuesday that the u.s. will be dispatching four aircraft carriers to the asia - pacific region this summer to conduct the largest - scale military exercises in ten years . 
roughead also said that the united states would , er , not , uh , view china , um , as a threat . 
the u.s. military hopes to be able to conduct another round of joint exercises with china 's people 's liberation army . 
this statement of position immediately attracted the concern of american defense experts . 
the heritage foundation , an american think tank , held a seminar wednesday concerning the pentagon 's defense evaluation report . 
the delicate relationship between the defense report and the military exercises became one of the focal points of the discussion . 
some feel that roughead 's public invitation to china to participate in the military exercises is a good will gesture toward china on the part of the united states . 
at the same time that it invited china to participate in the military exercises , the u.s. also mentioned its hope that the operations of china 's people 's liberation army would become more transparent . some defense experts therefore believe this demonstrates that the pentagon is puzzled by china 's intentions to expand its military , and hopes to use joint military exercises to engage in mutual probing and exploration . 
additionally , because the defense evaluation report issued by the pentagon earlier this month views china as the greatest future potential threat , two defense experts have also indicated that asia - pacific military exercises are the u.s. defense department 's $number step toward adjusting its strategy based on this . 
xie xiaoshuang , phoenix satellite news , reporting from washington . 
also , much attention is being focused on , uh , the american military exercises this summer , because this is $number time in ten years , ah , that the u.s. has had four , uh , aircraft carriers jointly participate in one military exercise , and , uh , it is $number time since the , uh , vietnam war , that the u.s. has moved aircraft carriers from the east coast to the , uh , western pacific region to conduct such military exercises . 
so these military exercises are in fact quite close together - - there will be four of them over several months . 
er , included among them will be one military exercise involving more than one country . 
so this multinational military exercise will include japan , uh , korea and australia . 
now a look at today 's headlines . 
on the $number , chinese engineers and technical personnel were attacked by gunmen in the southern pakistan province of balochistan . 
three engineers from hefei in anhui province were killed , as was their pakistani driver . 
local police described this incident as a blatant terrorist attack . 
the chinese consulate general in karachi has already taken up the matter with the local government , handled related matters arising from the incident , and demanded that the pakistani authorities apprehend the assailants .

er , after hearing this news , he expressed a high degree of concern for the safety of chinese engineers and technicians in pakistan .

additionally , hu jintao also expressed deep grief for the chinese personnel who were killed , and conveyed sincere condolences to the families of the deceased . 
all right , let 's contact chen yiming , islamabad correspondent for the people 's daily , right away to get the latest news on this issue . 
hello , mr. chen . 
give us an overview of the latest progress in the investigation of the shootings of the chinese engineers . 
er , right , anchor . 
er , as i understand it from the chinese consulate general in karachi , um , er , china 's , uh , consulate general has , uh , already informed the , uh , unit where the deceased worked of this unfortunate incident . 
so , according to , uh , convention , um , the , er , final arrangements for the final affairs of the deceased should be made by their work unit , er , in consultation with , um , the families . 
additionally , pakistan 's , uh , ministry of foreign affairs also issued a statement yesterday . 
his , er , the statement indicated that , um , the , uh , instigators of this incident , er , intended to sow discord in relations between china and pakistan . 
er , the statement indicated , uh , that they would conduct a thorough investigation of this incident , and , er , would , uh , strengthen security guard work with respect to all , uh , chinese working in , um , this country , and it indicated that pakistan would do its utmost to prevent the recurrence of similar incidents . 
er , in addition , according to a report from pakistan 's privately - run geo on the evening of the $number , in an interview with that station that evening , baber bashir , the chief executive officer of pakistan 's attock cement factory , indicated that after the occurrence of this attack , pakistan , er , would arrange , um , for the remaining eleven chinese engineers and technicians working on this project to return to their countries , ah , as quickly as possible . 
in the interview , this bashir also said that concerning , ah , the doubts raised by some pakistani media about why , er , when the incident occurred , the chinese engineers were not accompanied by security personnel , er , he said , uh , in fact , the factory where these engineers worked has its own security system , but because the location where the incident occurred was still within the scope of the factory area , there were no security personnel accompanying them when the incident occurr 
so , he expressed great regret at the occurrence of such an unfortunate incident . 
anchor . 
yes , all right . 
er , also , this was not $number time that chinese engineers were attacked and killed in pakistan . 
one previous instance of such an incident occurred in $date ' $number . 
two chinese engineers were kidnapped by an armed organization in south waziristan . 
ultimately , one of them lost his life during the rescue operation . 
and another was in may of the same year , when three engineers died in a bombing attack in gwadar . 
let 's take a look back for a moment . 
on $date , ' $number , in the port of gwadar in the southern part of pakistan 's balochistan province , a van carrying twelve chinese nationals encountered a car bombing attack on its way to a worksite at the harbor . 
the result : three chinese engineers died , and nine were injured . 
it is believed that this attack was initiated by local separatists and tribal militias . 
on $date of the same year , two chinese engineers were kidnapped by gunmen in the south waziristan region along the border between pakistan and afghanistan . 
during an attempt to rescue the hostages by pakistani forces soon thereafter , one of the engineers was unfortunately shot and killed . 
however , this hostage incident is believed to have been perpetrated by an armed organization related to a jihadist organization , not by the separatist militia . 
because china has a close economic relationship with pakistan , and is participating in the construction of pakistan 's infrastructure , a good many chinese engineering personnel work there . 
and pakistan has tribal militia organizations accusing the government of plundering their natural resources . 
this has resulted in multiple instances of chinese people becoming the victims of attacks and kidnappings . 
phoenix satellite news roundup 
let 's look at several news stories from japan . 
recently there was this bit of relatively shocking news from japan 's world of politics . 
which was that tsuneo watanabe , the , um , chairman of japanese media giant yomiuri shimbun , ordered , uh , yomiuri shimbun to publish some articles opposing koizumi 's visit to the yasukuni shrine , and yomiuri shimbun 's , um , position since then has , uh , been in opposition to koizumi 's visit . 
uh , so , in a speech several days ago , this tsuneo watanabe , uh , he criticized koizumi severely , saying that he was extremely ignorant and lacked any historical or cultural knowledge . 
at the same time , he also said that a visit by koizumi to the yasukuni shrine would be like paying tribute to hitler , and he said that by doing so , koizumi would cause china and korea to view japan as an extremely dangerous country , and this would be a constant source of trouble in the future . 
so why would this attitude of tsuneo watanabe 's cause such a great commotion ? 
in fact , he is very influential in political circles , and has always been a controlling character behind the scenes . 
and he , uh , was a person who was far to the right in the past . 
it should be said that he has always supported the hawk faction , and he has worked hard to promote amendment of the constitution . 
but , uh , now , he has truly made a major about face . 
he has turned the muzzle of his gun and begun shooting at koizumi , adopting an attitude of opposition . 
actually , when people attacked koizumi for visiting the yasukuni shrine $date , this tsuneo watanabe still said , uh , he said he supported it , and he wanted koizumi to resist the pressure . 
but in a recent talk , he said , " i 'm already $number years old , i don 't have much time left . " 
so now , he comes out in lofty tones , speaking out with a sort of very anti - war attitude . 
the effect of this , um , change of sides on his part on japanese society as a whole naturally remains great . 
for example , concerning himself , he said , " i firmly believe i have this kind of assurance and the ability to change political trends . " 
he also said that if yomiuri shimbun received government pressure in the areas of free speech and editorial freedom , he would resist it with his life . 
so what kind of situation has taken shape now ? 
japan 's biggest newspaper , yomiuri shimbun , and japan 's $number biggest newspaper , the super asahi shimbun , have begun to join hands in opposition to koizumi 's yasukuni shrine visits . 
originally , these two major papers were at odds with each other , but after the two chairmen met , they at least reached a consensus on this issue . 
thus now , both of them have adopted major offensives to , uh , criticize koizumi . they can be said to be a dream team . 
in fact , these two major newspapers should still have , uh , enormous influence on mainstream public opinion in japan . 
also , let 's take a look at the current legislative session in japan . at a recent meeting , two of the more popular candidates to succeed japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi both said the same thing . 
who are these two ? 
yes , one is chief cabinet secretary shinzo abe , and the other is japanese foreign minister tari aso , who has repeatedly made astonishing statements recently . 
what did the two of them say ? 
they said that japan 's , uh , world war ii war criminals were not criminals . 
what they meant was , uh , it was the international court that called them , um , criminals , and convicted them of crimes . 
but domestically in japan , based on international law , based on japan 's domestic laws , they , the war criminals , had not violated japan 's domestic laws . 
therefore , they believe that japan should not view the world war ii war criminals as criminals . 
at the same time , this shinzo abe also mentioned that japan should now turn its eyes to the world at large , develop its relationship with the united states , develop its trade relationships with certain southeast asian countries , and do its utmost to develop a close relationship with india , and not always focus on china .

as long as security evaluation institutions are in accordance with the relevant conditions and demands , even if they have not had their qualifications recognized by the cbrc , financial institutions can still use them to implement electronic banking security evaluation , but they should carry out management according to the relevant regulations .

( selected best of newspapers and periodicals ) shanghai : persons with concurrent jobs and graduates of institutions of higher education become main force of hourly wage earners . 
xinhua news $date from beijing . shanghai municipal ministry of labor and social security announced its ' guide to minimum hourly wages for $number ' on $date . the number of jobs covered reached $number , $number more than last time . wages for these jobs saw some increases and some decreases . 
according to the estimations of relevant experts at the shanghai municipal ministry of labor and social security , shanghai already has $number people who work for hourly wages . 
according to a report in " china youth magazine , " graduates from institutions of higher education and people holding concurrent jobs ( holding two or more jobs at once ) are the main constituencies making up the ranks that work for hourly wages . 
through direct surveying of nearly $number hourly paying jobs , it was found that over half of those surveyed hold concurrent jobs . the proportion of this group reaches $number of the whole . 
the level of culture of concurrent job holders is usually fairly high , they mainly are employed in jobs with relatively strong technical natures , such as translation positions where the proportion of concurrent laborers is as high as $number , and fitness areas where the proportion reaches $number . 
a high income is one important reason that many people are engaged in concurrent hourly paying jobs . 
according to our understanding , some positions have monthly incomes that can reach $number $number rmb , such as some hard to fill positions like simultaneous interpretation . the majority of hourly positions have monthly incomes reaching $number rmb or more , such as those concurrent positions in financial affairs , wedding masters of ceremonies , and so on . 
satisfying personal interests and expanding one 's knowledge is also an important reason that receives the attention of those holding concurrent jobs with hourly wages . 
for example , mr. gu , who holds the position of manager of the human resources department of a certain enterprise , will take a few hours of time every week to handle the financial accounts of the representative office of a certain foreign business . 
mr. gu believes that the biggest benefit of concurrent jobs is that it allows his knowledge to continually receive updates , and he has opportunities to be involved in another area . of course , a monthly income of $number rmb also has a certain attraction . 
because some hourly positions have low employment thresholds , the circumstances of the jobs are flexible and free and have progressively received the attention of many graduates currently looking for positions . among those making hourly wages , $number are university or technical school graduates of the past three years . 
" at $number i didn 't want to work for hourly wages , but after a few months , i think it 's better than going to work from nine to five . " 
after college student huang graduated , the job she found wasn 't very ideal . finally she registered her name with a hotel to play background music on the piano . 
" i am very satisfied with my current job . i make $number rmb an hour , and the environment is good , what i want to do now is find more hourly wage jobs . " 
according to our understanding , hourly wage work has already become an important path for graduates to accumulate work experience , exercise their working skills , increase their communication techniques , and grow social experiences . 
graduates doing hourly work are mainly concentrated on positions with relatively strong technical and intellectual natures , such as translation positions and similar positions with relatively high professional natures and highly era - stylistic performance art positions . their proportion of hourly wages is $number and $number respectively . 
some hourly work positions have lower technical skills , such as food sales promoter and tally clerks . unemployed persons can begin working these positions with only simple training . 
the data shows that the proportion of people working hourly wage jobs that were originally unemployed reaches $number , among which retail jobs have a proportion as high as $number of workers that were unemployed , and a proportion of $number among food and beverage jobs . hourly wage jobs have become an important channel for the unemployed .

chinese expert : america beating drum of ' chinese military threat ' is irrational criticism 
xinhua new $date from beijing ( reporters li xuanliang , xiong zhengyan , and lin liping ) the pentagon 's " quadrennial defense review report " formally handed over to congress in recent days has for $number time referred to china as 'the newly rising major nation most likely to present a military challenge to america ' . 
experts believe this is an irrational criticism of china 's normal defense construction , a dramatization of the ' chinese military threat theory ' , and is an interference in china 's internal affairs . 
the " quadrennial defense review report " is the pentagon 's new national defense policy paper . 
this $number page long report uses three sections to discuss the problem of chinese military force and what paths america should take to meet this problem . the report directly brings up ' china ' or ' chinese ' a total of $number times , saying 'as a major and newly prosperous large nation , china has the most potential to carry out military competition with america . if america does not have counter - measures , china will likely develop destructive military technologies , thus breaking america 's ad 
researcher yao yunzhu of the world military research department of the china military science institute says that , although high level american officials have expressed similar views many times before , this is $number time america put forward that ' china is the newly rising major country most likely to present a military challenge to america ' in its 'defense strategy reports ' . 
' this report for $number time clearly takes russia , india , and china as newly rising strategic opponents , among which it especially gives even more consideration to the so called chinese military threat theory . '

worth noting is that on the same day that the " quadrennial defense review report " was formally handed in , american president bush also handed to congress the government budget for fiscal year $number , in which the defense budget reached $number usd . 
' if you add on to this the budget for the military movements in iraq and afghanistan , america 's $number fiscal year defense budget will breakthrough $number usd , setting a new historic high ' peng guangqian said . ' this is nearly equal to the total military expenditures of all other countries in the world put together . ' 
peng guangqian believes that the method of america concocting 'threat theories from other countries ' reflects the pentagon 's usual style of 'creating enemies . ' its real aim is in striving for even more defense expenditures , and dredging up even more profits for america 's huge military industrial complex . 
experts say , compared with america 's huge military expenditures , china 's defense expenditures are relatively limited . 
military expert deng hongzhou , who has taken part in the writing of china 's defense white paper several times , said that since $date , along with economic development , china 's defense expenditures have increased , but have shown a declining trend in the total proportion of national revenue expenditures of the same period . 
official data shows that $date as compared to $number , china 's defense expenditures fell by ten percentage points in terms of the proportion of national revenue expenditures of the same period . 
$date , china 's defense expenditures were $number rmb , equal to only approximately $number of america 's . average per capita military expenditures are only equal to $number of america 's . per capita spending on military personnel is only equal to approximately $number of america 's . 
' america 's land area is about equal to china 's land area , but military expenditures of the two countries have a huge difference . it is self evident which country has military strength that exceeds its normal defense needs . ' 
peng guangqian said . 
teng jianqun , director of the research department of china 's military control and disarmament association , expressed that america should objectively appraise the situation of china 's military construction . china 's peaceful development does not mean that china and america will become military opponents in the future . 
the " china 's defense $date " white paper said china staunchly follows the path of peaceful development , and carries out a defensive national defense policy . 
china has never become a threat to any country in the past or present , and will not become a threat in the future . 
up until now , china has not established military bases in any country , and has not sent one soldier to any other country , while america has $number military bases abroad , and in the asian pacific region alone has in excess of $number military forces deployed . 
professor zhu feng of beijing university 's international relations institute said that china and america should go through already established channels to increase communication and exchanges , increase understanding and mutual trust , comprehensively further chinese and american constructive cooperative relations in the new century and jointly promote maintaining world peace and development .

( international observation ) hamas looks for breakthrough in forming cabinet 
xinhua news $date from ramallah ( internationl observation ) . hamas looks for breakthrough in forming cabinet 
xinhua news reporter hao huangmin 
after the palestine islamic resistance movement ( hamas ) obtained victory in legislative elections , how it will paint a blueprint for a new government has become a focal point the whole world is concerned with at the moment . 
what kinds of new policies hamas will put forth will directly influence the direction taken by all concerned parties in corresponding policy for the peace process . 
at the same time , the attitude of resistance of america and israel adds even more variables to the prospects of the hamas government . 
at present , various palestinian factions are currently tightening their cooperation , and are actively searching for breakthroughs on the future development of the situation on sensitive points and difficulties that forming a cabinet involves . 
( sub heading ) who will the position of premier fall to ? 
after hamas obtained the right to form the cabinet , there have been people in the outside world who worry a ' hamas premier ' will likely see differently than the current high leader abbas . 
also , hamas leader mashal , who is currently visiting egypt , emphasized that the new palestinian government established by hamas leaders will not continue to recognize israel . this intransigent standpoint also intensifies the worry of the international community . 
america and israel explicitly state they will not accept a hamas government that controls real power , and have used this threat to cut off economic support and transmission of taxation to palestine . 
however , this has not obstructed hamas in making flexible policy adjustments - choosing independents is a policy to split the difference . 
according to reports , to acquire international approval across the largest range possible , earlier domestic and foreign hamas leaders meeting together in egypt decided to choose independent ismail haniyeh , chairman of the board of trustees of the islamic university in gaza , to be appointed the new premier . 
this move has still not received the responses of concerned parties . 
palestine analyst hussein said that no matter who the position of premier falls to , what is most crucial is the choice for premier must dilute the 'hard ' aspects of hamas as much as possible . only by doing this can the successful forming of a cabinet be secured . 
( sub heading ) how to allocate power 
looking at the internal makeup of the party , the biggest challenge that hamas faces in forming a cabinet is it lacks ample experience being in power . 
the palestine " daily " published an analysis saying that while hamas gathered popularity through social welfare projects , in the area of being in power it lacks experience . hamas cooperating with the palestinian national liberation movement ( fatah ) , which has experience being in power , would be the best strategy . 
hamas brought up establishing a 'government partner ' relationship with fatah after the elections to jointly establish a united ethnic government , however fatah has not given a positive response to this as of the present . 
opinions among those in the fatah party as to whether or not to enter the cabinet are not the same . one faction advocates participating in the new government , and thus having something to say ; another faction refuses the invitation of hamas , and would rather be an 'active opposition faction ' in the legislature . 
persons with sensitive information pointed out that under the advice of abbas , fatah is progressively leaning towards entering into the new government . 
although this might be the case , hamas and fatah would still haggle over the allocation of cabinet positions . 
besides this , another path would be to establish a cabinet that is free of party affiliations and outside the framework of the legislature . 
according to reports , hamas has also designed a technocracy government , but the concrete list of names is still unknown . 
in light of the attitude of israel and america , a technocracy government might still be accepted as a method to form a cabinet that would lessen outside pressure . 
according to regulations of the palestine " basic law , " after the new legislature convenes on the $date , the nominations for premier and forming of a cabinet will be completed in three to five weeks . 
( sub heading ) at a loss about armed forces 
the weapons in the hands of hamas are another thorny problem that the forming of a new government faces . 
america 's and israel 's attitude is extremely stiff . they staunchly demand hamas give up violence , and reject hamas taking part in government while carrying guns . 
hamas leader mashal emphasized on $date that armed resistance is the 'strategic choice ' of his organization . 
the arms problem in actuality includes two levels of problems : the legality of weapons , and the jurisdiction and management of armed forces . 
hamas has obtained international acknowledgement for being the largest party in the legislature elected in a democratic and free manner , allowing its subordinate armed faction the ' qawasameh tribe ' to use legal avenues to unify itself into the government 's security organizations . 
hamas once brought up unifying all armed factions into a palestine ethnic power organization 'people 's army . ' however it did not get a broad response , and also took criticism from the palestinian islamic jihad movement . 
at present , palestine has $number security organization personnel , the vast majority of which come from the fatah camp . 
also , fatah has some subordinate armed factions with loose organizational relations , such as the 'al - aqsa martyrs ' brigades ' and the ' fatah hawks ' and others . 
hamas , which is responsible for forming the cabinet , must come to an understanding with abbas on how to manage these armed forces that each have their own power structures , and allocate the power of management of security in a reasonable way . 
according to the reports of local media , abbas is interested in managing the security and information regiments , while the police and people 's guard and other organizations will be subordinate to the management of the department of the interior of the new government . 
however , all sides are still carrying out discussions on this sensitive issue , and as of now there is nothing further .

japanese researchers develop new model highly effective artificial kidney 
xinhua news $date from tokyo ( reporter qian zheng ) researchers of japan 's tokai university have developed a kind of biological artificial kidney . it not only has the same catabolic functions as a human kidney , it also has functions to maintain useful substances . it has a small volume , is easy to transplant , and with more research there is hope it will bring good fortune to kidney disease patients . 
according to a report in previous days in the " nikkei business daily " , the newly developed biological artificial kidney is mainly made up of two parts . one part is the 'artificial kidney unit ' that strains out waste material and water from blood , the other part is the 'artificial urine tubes ' that returns water , amino acids and other useful materials back into the blood from crude urine . 
the 'artificial kidney unit ' and the 'artificial urine tubes ' are both made up of hollow fibers . the inner side of the 'artificial urine tubes ' are lined with the epithelia of urine tubes that have the function of dissimilating waste material . 
this type of epithelia can make diseases brought about by multiple blood dialysis - such as the materials causing the formation of 'amyloid degeneration related to dialysis ' dissolve into amino acids and return to the blood , while also allowing the glucose , vitamins , minerals and other things that the body needs returned to the blood . 
artificial kidneys in the past relied on the difference between permeation pressure to filter metabolized waste , and could not totally get rid of everything . they also did not have the function of returning amino acids and other materials back into the blood . 
researchers used a goat to carry out transplant experiments with the artificial kidney . pig epithelia was used for the hollow fibrous inner wall of the artificial kidney used . 
after two weeks , researchers confirmed that the artificial kidney was functioning . 
at present they are developing a biological artificial kidney using cells from human kidneys , and will begin clinical research after they verify its safety .

( winter olympics - stimulants ) news analysis : pyleva incident likely to end inconclusive 
xinhua news $date from turin . news analysis : pyleva incident likely to end inconclusive 
xinhua news reporter gao peng and ding ying 
although italy repeatedly issued orders saying that all athletes discovered using stimulants during the turin olympics would likely face " the specter of jail ; " however , looking at various circumstances it seems that the main character in $number stimulant scandal of this winter olympics , russian biathlon athlete olga pyleva , will not likely face jail - time . 
the turin olympic committee revealed $number stimulant scandal of the games on $date . it was discovered that olga pyleva used the prohibited stimulant carphedon . 
the next day , the international olympic committee announced that pyleva had already been expelled from the winter olympics , and the gold medal she won in the women 's biathlon $number km individual race at this winter olympics had already been stripped from her . 
the international biathlon union passed a punitive decision to ban pyleva from competition for two years . 
it has always been that the international olympic committee stipulated that athletes discovered using stimulants at the olympic games would have their scores cancelled and have their qualifications for taking part in events taken away , but they would not receive the punishment of the law . 
however , according to italian law , athletes carrying and using stimulants is considered criminal behavior and judicial authorities have the right to directly arrest and investigate the athlete using stimulates . those defying the law face anywhere from three months to three years in prison . 
last $date , the international olympic committee and the italian government concluded " negotiations " that had lasted as long as a year , finally reaching an agreement that both sides would deal with athletes using stimulants according to italian law at this winter olympics . 
after the tireless efforts of the international olympic committee , italy gave a concession four days before the opening ceremony for the winter olympics , promising that during the winter olympics police would not enter the olympic village and search the residences of athletes . however , athletes that showed positive for drugs would still be investigated by italian authorities . 
reports state that mario pescante , the official supervising the turin olympics for the italian government , has already handed over the pyleva stimulant incident to turin investigating authorities . 
however , the international olympic committee and pescante have not confirmed this as of present . 
russian team doctor for the biathlon team andrey dmytriev revealed on $date that pyleva had already left turin and returned to russia . 
chinese sports official shi liancheng , who worked for many years at the world anti - stimulant organization , believes that as soon as pyleva returns to russia , this incident 's ending will likely be " inconclusive . " 
shi liancheng said that the international olympic committee and the italian government have never " thoroughly resolved " the anti - stimulant problems at the winter olympics , and although the italian investigating authorities have indeed come into play , the results are hard to predict . 
looking at the punishments in judgment of cases of domestic athletes using stimulants in italy , the most serious punishments that offenders have received is no more than " two years of suspended imprisonment . " 
therefore , senior reporter pieri of italy 's ansa news expressed that the likelihood of pyleva going to prison is " extremely small , " and at most a fine will be given . 
pieri expressed that although italian courts can carry out sentencing without the accused present , italian police are not likely to go abroad to bring pyleva back for punishment . 
if pyleva refuses to accept the judgment , then italy will have no way to get her .

& lt ; headline & gt ; hope but no assurance for championship 
& lt ; poster & gt ; love life love luneng 
the battle field of china 's soccer superbowl will soon see war . 
the luneng taishan ( of shandong province ) soccer team is getting ready for the next season , preparing to make another advance for the championship . 
three strong teams , dalian , luneng , and shanghai , will fight for the championship 
in the end , who will be the champion ? 
according to analysis of their strength , although the luneng team has great hope of winning the championship , it does not have $number assurance . 
$number of all , the new players only have a short time to train and be broken in . 
last year luneng came home empty from the four big games . 
this year luneng has brought in two famous national players , li leilei and wang liang , and soon there will be two foreign players that will join the ranks as well . the team 's power can be said to have had increases and no decreases . 
however , because the national team must prepare for competitions with pakistan and iraq , the national players won 't be able to practice with their team mates . 
when they finally return to their club , the tournament will begin shortly ; 
thus the breaking in and integration of new players is the biggest problem faced by luneng . 
i think that in $number few rounds of the tournament they should let the national players play $number string . 
firstly they can use the competitions to break in and integrate the ranks , 
and secondly they can allow these players who played in two national group competitions to rest a bit . 
after a few rounds , when the 'knives ' are broken in , it will not be too late for them to come into play . 
also , the team has hidden trouble with its defense . 
in the past , luneng 's defense has been denounced by fans , 
this year , with the addition of li leilei , the team 's defense has improved but is far from being foolproof . 
the problem of middle rear guards being slow at turning around the ball still exists , and $number string players are either too old or lack experience . 
if middle rear guards are stable in their abilities this year , then another step will be taken toward luneng 's road to the championship . 
i believe that the team should use ren yongshun , whose physical condition is good . although he lacks experience , he can train this year , and prepare for the present and future . 
besides this , gao yao is good at playing both forward and rear positions . 
luneng has many players that can play center field , cui peng and hai bin can play this position . 
gao yao 's body is strong , he 's good at stealing the ball , and in the position of middle rear guard he should be able to do a good job . 
once again , if the foreign players will be suitable or not is a problem . 
foreign players are a big problem that has always complicated luneng . 
last year , the unleashing of ionel danciulescu left many unimpressed , 
and selections for this year 's foreign players have still not been made . 
i think that this year , besides bringing in a extraordinary forward , they should also bring in a pure left forward guard , 
except for xing rui from several years ago , luneng doesn 't have a left footer in the true meaning . 
although cui peng and other can live up to the position , a true left forward guard would be much better than guest players . 
if these three problems are resolved , luneng 's road to gain the championship should be more even . 
as a luneng fan , i hope that luneng wins the championship this year , 
however , to tell the truth , the shape of this year 's championship has luneng with great hopes but no great assurances . 
& lt ; headline & gt ; batey ads merges with jwt.com ; is it too late to say happy new year ? 
& lt ; poster & gt ; brandvista post : 
hello everybody , 
spring festival has once again run past us just like that , and those friends who put their vacation time and their spring festival holiday break together are one by one returning to their jobs . 
wishing all friends a happy new year , if i say happy new year now it doesn 't count as too late . 
one day i was chatting with nplcn in a cafe , and he talked about today 's brandvista . 
the website is much more beautiful , 
the placement of content isn 't bad , 
and what he liked most was the community bbs based on discuz , which is now getting a comprehensive update . 
mentioning the community , i must thank a certain person , 
that is the general manager of the discuz beijing company , mr. li mingshun . 
doing a search on google with his name , you 'll get many results ; 
you probably know that before he was at sina , he established a business himself , making a small - and medium - enterprise internet advertisement exchange platform similar to the foreign adbrite.com . 
at that time i argued with him on msn that his main meaning was : vista thinks the development of many of china 's industries relies on the strengthening of the private economy and small and medium industries , 
and currently in the chinese market , this situation does not allow people to be optimistic ; 
thus creative industries and similar consultative agencies in service of small and medium enterprises have no way to take shape in any scope , 
and demand a relatively high fee to facilitate self development , finally leading to a recurring cycle that is not encouraging . 
later he came to discuz . 
discuz is a truly outstanding community program based on the php and mysql databases ; 
with the help of beijing technical engineer ramboo , the brandvista community finally saw light once again , and came into the market in full force . 
feedback has been very good , 
the user interface is clean and friendly , 
the speed is fast ; 
under a spotlessly clean user interface , writing a little text that leaves me inspired and others enlightened , and exchanging every little fact about life and work with friends and coworkers with the same pursuits , i began to believe that this is a kind of joy . 
thank you discuz !

look at this article , and share it ; 
this is not an impulse on thought , instead it is warm goodness long held in one 's heart . 
ask yourself if it were you , what would you have done ; 
the answer is very clear , i would have put down the telephone saying , " wrong number . " 
this year i have been thinking about when all is said and done , what actually counts as helping people . 
i have already abandoned all behaviors like donating money and donating items . 
in the last few days i 've had friends say , i already have no time to care for myself ; in helping people , my heart is full of vigor but by my strength lacking . 
wishing you a day of happiness : )

mother of ten years ago 
it was one day ten years ago when this teacher was using the noon rest time to sleep at her home ; suddenly the telephone rang . 
she received the call and listened , and out came a strange and rough sound : " your child was stealing books and now she 's been caught by us , come quickly ! " 
from out of the receiver also came the noise of a young girl crying , and the sounds of chiding from people surrounding the young girl . 
she looked over at her only daughter who was watching tv , and she immediately understood . 
it was definitely a young girl who was caught by the salesperson stealing books , but was not willing to allow her family to learn of this ; thus , she made up a phone number , and by coincidence it rung at the teacher 's home . 
of course the teacher could put down the phone and take no notice of this - - she could even rebuke the person on the receiving end , 
because this event had no connection to her whatsoever . 
but she was a teacher , and maybe the girl was her student 
through the telephone , she could vaguely imagine that the little girl who had a momentary lapse in judgment with serious consequences must be extremely nervous and scared ; she was facing perhaps the most frightening circumstances ever in her life . 
after hesitating for a moment the teacher suddenly thought of an idea - - yes , she 'd just do it . 
therefore , after she got the address of the bookstore , she immediately went there . 
just as she expected , in the bookstore stood a little girl with a face full of tears , 
and the adults around her were fiercely chiding her . 
she rushed up at once , hugging that poor little girl and turning to the salesperson by her side , saying , " talk to me about this , don 't frighten the child . " 
while the salesperson grumbled that he was not willing , she handed over a fine of $number rmb before taking this little girl out of the bookstore and getting a clear look at a face in a complete mess with tears and panic . 
she began smiling and took the little girl to her home , cleaned her up without asking anything , and then allowed the little girl to leave . 
before she left , the teacher urged her : " if you want to read , just come to me ; there are many books here . " 
the little girl whose spirits were still rattled took a good look at her , and then ran off like she was flying , never appearing again . 
time passed rapidly like running water , and without realizing it , ten years of time had passed in a flash ; 
the teacher had already forgotten this event long ago , but she still lived in the same place , leading a peaceful and serene life . 
one day at noon , a knocking sound came from outside the door . 
after she had opened the house door , she saw a young and beautiful unfamiliar girl , who had a face full of smiles and a large pile of gifts in her hands . 
" who are you looking for ? , " 
she asked uncertainly . 
the girl then excitingly talked at length . 
with great difficulty , she suddenly discovered from the story told by this strange girl that it turned out she was the little girl from before , ten years before ; she had already graduated from college without any trouble , and now she had gone to the trouble to come to pay a call to the teacher . 
the eyes of this young girl were glinting with tears , and she spoke softly : " although i still don 't understand even to this day why were you willing to pretend you were my mother and rescue me , i always think , during these past ten years , about how i 've always wanted to call you mother . " 
the teacher 's eyes also began to become fuzzy ; 
she asked with some curiosity : " if that day i had not helped you , what would have been the result ? " 
the girl 's face immediately became somber ; lightly she shook her head and said ; " i can 't say for sure ; perhaps i would have done something stupid , even died . " 
the teacher 's heart suddenly trembled and she began to inwardly congratulate herself . 
the decision that she made in a moment of thought that year could actually influence the life of a person in such a way as this . 
looking at the happy smiles on the face of the girl she also began to smile . 
& lt ; poster & gt ; zhang xiwen 
with this world full of lies and false pretenses , such as junk smss flying everywhere , the buddha says , if i don 't enter hell , who will enter hell ? 
whoever wants to do this , then congratulations , he can become a buddha quite soon . 
man 's nature at birth is good , 
everybody has a heart of compassion ; 
the moral values of today 's world are worsening , man 's heart is not what it used to be ; 
perhaps only buddhas can abandon themselves and do some good . 
& lt ; headline & gt ; military survey : how long can iran last against american air strikes ? 
& lt ; poster & gt ; yun feiquan 
if you make the analogy of a traditional war of attrition as making your opponent bleed until he dies , then modern warfare is like firing a gun into your opponent 's head , making him become a 'vegetable ' before he can even begin to bleed . 
the difference between iran and america 's military does not lie in numbers , instead it lies in the understanding of modern warfare . 
iran , which fought an eight - year war with iraq with no clear winner , still seems to not have come to an understanding of the true meaning of modern high - tech warfare . 
in the last few days , after analyzing the redeployment of american forces , england 's " international intelligence commentary " pointed out that american forces are currently carrying out preparations to initiate a large scale air strike against iran . 
the current situation of iran 's air force worrisome 
the current situation of iran 's air force is relatively similar to iraq 's air force before the $number war . 
iran does not have the ability to research and develop modern weapons by itself , and also is restricted by a western arms embargo ; 
as soon as a war breaks out , whether or not the old aircraft in iran 's air force will be able to get into the air and engage american forces is still a big question . 
at present , iran 's air defense system is mainly made up of the air forces of iran 's regular army , land air defense units , and the air defense forces of the revolutionary guards . 
among its forces , iran 's air force has approximately $number soldiers , and has $number war aircraft of various types ; 
its main models include american - made f-4 ' phantoms ' , f-5 ' tigers ' , f-14 ' tomcats ' and russian - made mig 2 9 s and so on . 
land - based air defense units are mainly equipped with a series of american - made ' hawks ' , british ' rapiers ' and some russian - made ' sam ' land - to - air missiles . 
as to the present situation of iran 's air defense power , american military expert harold hutchinson and russian government and military analysis institute military expert vladimir mytashin and others have analyzed this . they believe that , looking at the current situation , there still exist some leaks in iran 's air defense abilities and the air defense system establishment . 
hutchinson believes that , talking about its comprehensive strength , iran 's air forces and america 's military are just not on the same level . 
a great number of american - made fighters that iran is equipped with cannot be used because they lack spare parts and need upgraded maintenance . 
as of now only $number or a few more of the f-14 fighters which were once seen as the trump card in iran 's air force can even get off the ground and fly , 
and the actual battle reliability of the aim-54 model ' phoenix ' cruise missile , which is reputed to have over the horizon strike ability , is suspicious . 
mytashin points out that the air defense missile systems that america supplied to iran $date and $date have already lost their battle abilities because they lack spare parts , 
and some other air defense weapons not incorporated into their own systems obtained from russia and other countries have no ability whatsoever to contend with american forces that have strong electromagnetic countermeasures . 
a pieced together force influences iran 's fighting power 
iran 's government obviously has recognized that its fate in a war depends on whether or not it can defend the skies above its head , and has thus made preparations at the last minute , and tried to further piece together and strengthen its air defense systems . 
looking at this at the present , iran 's method can be boiled down to these two strategies : 
$number , hide important nuclear facilities with the utmost effort , and strengthen their ability to resist attack . 
according to england 's " the times , " iran already has deeply hidden its natanz nuclear factory and isfahan uranium enrichment center $number meters underground , and added a two - meter thick concrete protecting shell . 
however , american forces are one step ahead . as early as during the $number gulf war , america had seen the efficiency of underground bunkers in air defense warfare and carried out an onslaught of research and development on various kinds of earth - penetrating bombs . 
after $number years of specific research and development , american forces now already have a whole series of battle methods and weapons to deal with underground reinforced bunkers . 
recently iran also purchased advanced air defense weapons from russia . 
since late last year , the iranian government and russia have successively reached agreements on the purchase of ' pechora ' 2 a model air defense missile systems , as well as $number ' tor " m1 model air defense missile systems worth $number usd . 
however , modern warfare is a measuring of system against system . 
all of america 's various air strike weapons were researched and developed by america , have seen many years of actual battle hardening , and have already been ground into a set of battle machines with objective effectiveness . 
whereas iran has been piecing together 'new weapons ' from other countries . it is still a question if iran can create any battle power in such a short time . 
iran 's deficiencies not only in weapons 
the ' airland battle ' concept was $number brought up in " operations " published by the u.s. armed forces $date . it emphasized taking advantage of air superiority to carry out strikes on the enemy 's strategic high value targets , and paralyzing the command system of the enemy as soon as war began , making enemies with even large and strong regular armed forces just " a piece of meat on the cutting board . " 
in the $number gulf war , the $number kosovo war and the $number iraq war , what american forces have been concerned about is not how many aircraft the opponent has , but instead the range of its ' tomahawk ' cruise missiles . 
the iranian government is already carrying out preparations for air strikes that might happen , and has also begun procedures to strengthen its air defense abilities . however , iran , which fought an eight - year war with iraq with no clear winner , still seems not to have come to an understanding of the true meaning of modern high - tech warfare . 
with the progress of military restructuring of american forces over the past few years , america 's air strike performance is already totally different than the carpet bombing of the vietnam era , and instead relies on various high - tech weapons , the support of high accuracy current information technology and total - depth air strike ability . 
facing these kind of air strikes , exactly how long iran 's land - based air defense systems can last is still an unknown .

& lt ; headline & gt ; joining with google to take on microsoft , dell takes " shelving fees " from software providers 
& lt ; poster & gt ; yun feiquan 
dell ( dell inc . us ) and google verified on tuesday that dell is currently testing the installation of a google software package on personal computers . 
this move will likely become a serious threat to the leading position in the personal computer software market of microsoft ( microsoft corp , msft ) . 
jess blackburn , news spokesman for dell , expressed that his company is currently evaluating google 's software . 
after installing this software , personal computer users can use it to carry out searches on the internet and also search the information saved on personal computers . 
blackburn verified that at present the software his company is evaluating includes a dell homepage supported by google , a google desktop search system and a google tool bar . 
at the same time , google news spokesman jon murchinson verified his company is currently testing a batch of software developed by google with dell . 
before this , " the wall street journal " had a report saying that it parvenu google is currently carrying out talks with dell , hp ( hewlett - packard ) and others , aiming to convince these computer manufacturing giants to install google software on their computers . 
according to " the wall street journal , " which cited a person with inside information , to reach this goal google will likely pay as much as $number usd to dell over the next three years . 
however , neither of the two companies has revealed any relevant details . 
besides this , hp has declined to comment . 
microsoft news spokesperson neil charney refused to comment on the above news . 
at present , microsoft is currently planning to release the search tools of the next generation windows operating system , as well as strengthening the development of its online services . 
the day that this news became public , google stock once again fell by $number , reaching $number usd . 
microsoft stock fell $number that day , closing at $number usd . 
some analysts point out that google is currently impatiently searching for a direction for expansion besides internet searches , and joining with dell and other pc giants will spur google on to threaten microsoft 's central services . 
analyst matt rosoff of market research company directions on microsoft expressed that google is impatient to expand new income flows . this is certainly what microsoft is concerned and worried about . 
however , there are also analysts who don 't think so . 
analyst charles di bona of market analysis company sanford c. bernstein pointed out that it is still too early for google to shake microsoft windows ' leading position . 
noted by the reporter : google loosening up microsoft 's empire ? 
hui zhengyi 
there is no doubt that computers have already become a necessity of life and work . 
however , while everybody is familiar with operating computers , there are only a small number of people who actually understand the principles that make computers work . 
just like using 'simpleton ' cameras , as long as the user interface is good and you use convenient software , the great majority of dummies can still thoroughly enjoy their computer . 
because of this , the software that pc producers provide when they ship their goods often decides the use habits of a large number of consumers . 
microsoft has firmly taken hold of the personal computer operating system market through this measure . 
as of now , microsoft 's new opponent google also intends to use this method to take a share for itself . 
a famous taiwanese economic media outlet recently gave an interesting analogy to this . 
" dell , hp and other computer producers are starting to manage the computers they are sending out as the product shelves in a supermarket , and taking a " shelving fee " from software companies . 
successful bidders can make their software appear in the 'crucial $time ' when users $number turn on their new computers , and lead consumers to use their products . 
this type of fee pattern is like supermarkets taking a shelving fee from food suppliers . " 
there is no doubt that this phenomenon shows that microsoft 's control is currently loosening . 
microsoft managers have warned bill gates that if google starts to pay personal computer manufacturers to allow computers to be deployed with google 's software , then microsoft 's hegemonic position will in the end be threatened . 
no matter what the final result is , the leisurely days of microsoft sitting in the lead position will likely become history . 
after all , fighting an empire is easy , but defending an empire is hard .

sword of righteousness : looking forward to $number 
author : sword of righteousness 
i remember at the beginning of $number , hong kong 's " apple daily " published an article ; its title was " the falun wheel turns often to capture the enemy nation . " 
the article said that $number was a year in which falun gong advanced triumphantly . 
the article enumerated that all the manners in which the chinese communist party (ccp) overseas officials took to repress falun gong in various situations all failed , and students of falun gong across the world spoke the truth and left the ccp without any face . 
but if you compare the great surge of those quitting the party because of the " nine criticisms " of $number , then $number really doesn 't seem like much . 
so , what will $number bring ? 
from two events that happened early this year we can get an inkling as to the development of this year . 
$number event is the publishing of " eradicating evil . " this article pronounces a sentence that the final day of the ccp 's special operatives after $date will soon arrive . 
in regards to this article , perhaps many people will waver between believing or doubting it , or will not be able to believe it , 
but no matter if you believe it or not , history and fact will provide proof ! 
of course , the special operatives of the ccp are just like rats that live in the sewer , 
their " natural or unnatural " death will not bring the attention of society or public opinion , 
however , the large - scale smiting or repentance of domestic and foreign based ccp operatives will bring about a huge attack and convulsion to the ccp power hierarchy ! 
under the awful magnitude of the smiting of their world , they will have to seriously consider their path of retreat and path of life - - quit the party , revolt and run , or change sides . 
because of this , the ' ccp hyper - stable bureaucratic system bloc ' held up by filthy interests will begin to shake , dissolve and collapse ! 
there is also one event , that is , the hunger strike movement against those maintaining power begun by gao zhisheng . 
this movement that began suddenly and was not well received at $number , exceeded expectations and received an enthusiastic response from all over the world , and was responded to jointly by figures and forces everywhere . 
if this movement can become a nexus between various righteous powers and the suffering people , as well as become successful and large , then the final hit to the ccp , this wicked regime that is on the precipice ready to fall , will be given . 
if we say that $number was the year that defeated communism on the spiritual level , then $number is the stage of defeating communism on a spiritual and material level . 
with the further promulgation of the " nine criticisms , " the deepening of the tide of people quitting the party , the self - dissolution of the ccp itself and the agglomeration and shaping up of outside righteous power , the life of the ccp monster will formally enter its final hours ! 
the desires of heaven and earth have already coalesced , the hand of god and the power of the people are currently assembling . 
the long sword that relies on heaven is directly pointed at the ccp monster ! 
if you say $number was a year in which we advanced triumphantly , and $number is a year in which we surged forward with great momentum , then what will the end words be for $number ? 
i hope it will be a huge change that startles heaven , victory and triumphant return !

& lt ; headline & gt ; xu zhiyong : a letter to linyi city committee secretary li qun 
& lt ; poster & gt ; fabuer 
poster : sunnypku ( sunny ) , 
letter area : square 
title : xu zhiyong : a letter to linyi city committee secretary li qun - gangster methods will hurt you 
posting website : like old friends even though we just met ( wed $date $time $number ) , this website ( yjrg.net ) 
as of yesterday , the linyi government that you lead has already illegally held chen guangcheng under house arrest for $number days . 
you have joined with the gangster underworld to illegally imprison a legal citizen who has been blind in both eyes for a long time . 
you cut the telephone line in his home , and installed cell phone disrupting equipment in his courtyard . 
you have also beaten up his family members on numerous occasions . 
your barbaric actions have already passed beyond the bottom margin of civilized society . 
in $date you used gangster methods to beat up me and lawyer li fangping , but we endured it , and always did our best to understand your difficulties , even tolerating you putting chen guangcheng under house arrest for a time . 
however , $number days have passed , and you have not constrained yourselves , and instead have become even more severe . 
you send out large teams of police and gangsters to harass the village citizens . 
you continue to arrest and beat up village citizens . 
you have already gone too far ! 
today , while you continue to organize gangsters to surround and block cheng guangcheng , i clearly remind you that gangster methods will in the end hurt yourself . 
the beginning of the situation is worth your looking back and thinking about . 
linyi 's family planning is dead last for the entire province , 
and as the secretary of the city committee , you being somewhat worried is understandable . 
however , thinking that you can only use violence and force to implement national legal policies because linyi 's citizens are unsophisticated is wrong . 
citizens not cooperating with the behavior of the government , in the end whose fault is this ? 
is it because citizens are unsophisticated , or is it because the government has for a long time used lies and deceits leading to very low public confidence ? 
if you say that $number years ago this kind of governmental behavior still didn 't seem that preposterous ; then $date , when chinese society has already had obvious improvements and human rights protection has already been added into the constitution , don 't you think that your barbaric behavior is far off the mark ? 
why don 't you think about it a bit ? why is it only you guys in linyi that still dare to do stuff like this ? 
how is it that you guys in linyi cannot use democratic and legal methods to enforce the law ? 
when chen guangcheng and a group of brave citizens reported the facts of this barbaric enforcing of the law , through the involvement of teng biao and a group of lawyers bravely maintaining the rights of citizens and after the state family planning committee completed its investigations , linyi city could have heartily given an explanation and come to an understanding with the public . 
after all , family planning is a problem characteristic of china . 
everybody could have understood and forgiven your difficulties . 
however , you took further absurd actions - catching chen guangcheng in beijing and bringing him back . you also implicated him in the crime of illegally providing national confidential information . 
don 't you think that this crime is rather absurd for a blind person who lives in a poor mountain village ? 
actually , you only need to correct your mistakes , you only need to do good . do you really fear the criticism of a blind person ? 
do you really have to assign $number people to watch over him $time a day and even try to pin utterly preposterous crimes onto him ? 
on $date , lawyer li fangping and i went to the ancient village of dongshi where we expressed an extremely clear standpoint hoping to resolve this contradiction . 
we suggested that we $number talk with your officials , and see what ideas and demands you had . 
we took the initiative and suggested we would help you persuade chen guangcheng not to say certain things . 
we hoped that you wouldn 't treat a blind person in such ways , and both parties should have concessions . 
however , your decision maker insisted on doing things his own way and he even set up a " meticulous scheme " of his own - to beat us up and illegally detain us . 
do you think you can frighten us into submission in this way ? 
we have done nothing against the law , 
we have no fear , 
and although china 's rule of law is not perfect , it is not that there is no law and no heaven above . 
do you think you can frighten us into submission by using gangster methods ? then you have seriously underestimated our resolve and perseverance . 
as long as we are willing , we have many people and many legal reasons to go to linyi , or go and see chen guangcheng . 
you can beat up lawyer and scholar once , twice , three times ; every time will be widely reported and paid attention to . 
do you really dare to beat us $number times ? 
are you not very concerned with your official post ? 
if there is anybody who is really hurt , is your official position that secure ? 
if you do not listen to our reasonable advice , and instead employ some low - level gangster methods , don 't you think this is very dangerous and very foolish ? 
i want to clearly tell you that in china there are many outstanding citizens who obey the law and are true to their consciences . 
we aren 't afraid of the gangster underworld , 
and we cannot abide the wanton trampling of the lowest margin of human civilization . 
if you go too far , we will confidently and calmly face your clubs with group after group and go forward until you finally shrink back . 
it should be clear to you , using gangster methods is nothing good for you . 
don 't think that you can hide behind a curtain and be free of your relationship with those ruffian gangsters who beat up villagers . 
in the end , i want to remind you , please be nice to chen guangcheng . 
this person who has been blind since childhood , graduated from the institute of chinese medicine , self - studied law and english , once sued beijing 's subway company to get better benefits for the blind , brought running water to the villagers , and became the famous " lawyer chen " known near and far . 
you went as far as using shameless persons to slander him on the internet , and also tried to frame him with the crime of illegally providing confidential information to foreigners . don 't you think that you have gone too far ? 
your house arrest of chen guangcheng is illegal , and is dangerous to you as well . 
originally you could have released him , 
and although your barbaric execution of the law would have stopped , even if he criticized you , how long could he go on ? 
instead , today you are continuing to further debase your own image . 
as long as chen guangcheng does not get freedom , you will not get one day of rest . 
your torture of him is already enough , 
and if you still want to pin a crime on him or still want to utilize further gangster methods , we will definitely not stand to the side and just watch . 
citizen xu zhiyong , $date . 
& lt ; headline & gt ; ( fwd ) does the chinese ethnicity deserve democracy ? 
& lt ; poster & gt ; exploring china 's peaceful path to liberation , pushing for the internal liberation of my countrymen . 
i am extremely disappointed to admit : the chinese ethnicity does not deserve democracy ! ! ! 
aren 't the people posting here doing just this thing ! 
it 's just sad that people on the internet seeing this are not many ( compared to $number ) , 
the number of people who are online and are concerned and take part in these types of subjects is even smaller : i am confident in asserting - they are less than $number of those that use the internet ! 
and what about this internet having the largest , most comprehensive , most advanced , most expensive , and best security programs in the world ! 
indeed . 
agony , disappointment , helplessness , even thinking of submission ; but to live one 's life , besides fighting yourself , who can you place hope on ? 
although the planning of affairs rests with man , to complete affairs rests with heaven . still , even if my plans do not succeed , if i do not work hard towards my ideals i will believe that i myself am wrong and deserve to live the life of a dog . 
working hard towards righteousness , i will add some beauty to my life in this way alone , at least in my heart and in my appraisal of myself . 
in fact , i don 't need to be worried with china 's future at all , 
because the world environment already cannot allow a regime that for a such a long time has not used elections . 
it 's only a matter of time . 
it 's just that i sigh that the chinese ethnicity is 'extremely lucky ' , we have always been put on a hellish path of torture and awfulness during the turns of history by world classed and superman classed monsters . even though some call the high piles of bones and pools of blood this path extracts as glorious , and force us to be proud of our gloriousness . 
dark nights are everywhere , china is endless . 
with china 's $number emperor qinshihuang and confucius , the people violently died young . 
qinshihuang was openly a tyrant , confucius brain washed covertly . 
it 's not that chinese are not deserving of democracy , it 's that the genes of democracy have already been repressed . 
for a nation that has been around for $number years , if its ethnic culture had democratic genes , then this nation would have much earlier become a democracy . 
when athens established a democratic system , when rome established a republic , when the english passed the magna carta , when the french published the declaration of the rights of man and of the citizen , when americans published the declaration of independence , what were the chinese doing ? 
before the mongolians came into the central china plains , the mongols elected a leader at the kurultai , the manchurians had democratic discussions of government between the king and ministers , why is it when they came to the han region these tendencies were put out ? 
the chinese pursue material resources , and have no interest whatsoever in spiritual beliefs and political power . 
i don 't believe it . if chinese had universal suffrage , they 'd sell it for a salty pancake . 
$number years later , if the chinese want democracy , then there will certainly need to be an earthquake ; those who can run , run !

the dali lama will go to washington this month . 
before the dali lama , the tibetan spiritual leader , arrives in america on $date , his special envoy expressed that the exiled tibetan government does not demand tibetan independence . 
kelsang gyaltsen said in washington that they hope the chinese government can indeed protect the unique culture and traditions of tibet . 
it 's predicted that when the dali lama visits america next week he will discuss the problem of tibet with president bush , and hope bush will urge the chinese government to give tibet true autonomous power . 
the dali lama 's representatives and beijing officials carried out direct contact this $date in berne . 
" true autonomy " 
kelsang gyaltsen pointed out that in the last several years the tibet exiled government and chinese authorities have see some positive aspects during talks . 
the special envoy of the dali lama discovered that beijing leaders , especially representatives of the united front work department of cpc central committee were willing to listen to their viewpoints . 
however , kelsang gyaltsen said that the tibet exiled government and the chinese government still had too many divergences , and the standpoint of both sides had too great a difference . 
he said that in the last five years , the exiled tibetan government had already done all it could to respond to china 's demand of creating a good environment for talks , 
and china should also create a good environment for the tibet problem , and not just attack the dali lama . 
he said that the dali lama does not demand tibetan independence , and tibet is a part of china , but the chinese government must protect the unique culture of tibet and " allow tibetans to truly have autonomy . " 
besides this , kelsang gyaltsen pointed out that some chinese think that once the dali lama dies , the tibet problem will disappear . 
he said this way of thinking is extremely dangerous , because once the dali lama is not around , china will have lost a historic opportunity to resolve the tibet problem . 
he said that , as long as the chinese government is responsive to the demands brought up by the dali lama , and puts forth a final method of resolution , the dali lama will then not need to discuss the tibet problem in the international community . 
& lt ; headline & gt ; negotiations and compromise are important methods of democracy ! (zt) 
& lt ; poster & gt ; hou ze 
i just saw the post of an internet friend on " vast righteousness - give old mr. gui ren . " 
his ( her ) original words were : " negotiations and compromise are important methods of democracy , otherwise democracy will fail because opinions are different and splits form ! ! ! this point should be amply paid attention to by those hoping for ideal democracy ! " 
these light and unflavorful words that did not stir any interest in my online friends got me thinking and lamenting . 
at this time i wanted to go to ancient china , and i also wanted to go to the past of the west . 
i , who seldom post main threads , could not help but post a main thread to reply to this post of my online friend . 
$number let us look at ancient china . 
everybody knows that china has been a centralized power since $number emperor , qinshihuang , established a unified china . after that all dynasties operated under this governmental framework . 
although in the han period they implemented a " two track system " for a short time , it was just a governmental system of simultaneous operation of feudalist and central power mechanisms , and in the end central power won out . 
the results of this type of central power system had its progressive side under the historic conditions of the time , and promoted the development of production capability . 
however , we should see that the results of $number years of operating under this system has lead to locations lacking the ingenuity , initiative , and pro - activeness they should have ; and in no way could that system set various governing policies suitable for local development with actions that suit local situations . 
a pyramid - like governing system also led to lower level officials only looking upward , in all respects taking orders from the next higher level . 
because the local officials of county seats were all appointed by the central government , there was no space for concessions and negotiations , and don 't even bother to bring up the common people . 
when the rights of ancient chinese farmers were encroached on , they could only endure it . 
only when their most basic rights were threatened - that is large scale starvation and the right of life being exploited by cruel government or natural disasters - would they raise up flags and resist . 
over $number years numerous peasant rebellions have swept across the nation ; from ones that had no forethought such as that led by chen sheng and wu guang to the planned yellow turban uprising , and again the huangchao violence of the tang dynasty , and the li zicheng uprising that ruled as a dynasty for one month . except for zhu yuanzhang , all of these did not gain victory in the true meaning . 
even the ming dynasty established by zhu yuanzhang was no more than the replacing of one dynasty with another , and there weren 't changes in the system of government . 
zhu yuanzhang , who was born a commoner and did not have much culture , took china 's ancient centralized power system to an abnormal and extreme state , therein losing the vigorous and vital aspects of freedom and tolerance of the tang dynasty that system enjoyed , making the system inert . 
any room for discussions of freedom disappeared on the chinese mainland , 
the nature of humanity received the greatest suppression , 
and everyone became overcautious , in awe and reverence of the government , and did not dare to say too much . 
this was the aftermath of the only peasant rebellion that was successful in $number years , leaving the chinese people with a meager existence for a time . 
now let 's look at the middle ages that are called the dark ages in western europe . 
western europe 's middle ages was $number year era that took shape after western rome was destroyed by nomadic peoples . these middle ages had no connection to ancient greece and rome . 
this era 's main characteristic was feudalism , that is dividing up lands ; 
land was divided up further and further among lords and the lower levels had more self - governing rights . 
no matter if one was a small feudal lord of a few square kilometers of land , or a male aristocrat with a royal title ; because those higher and lower could mutually balance , restrict , and rely on each other , they had the conditions and ability to strive for the rights they should have from their king . this produced the situation of kings and aristocrats sitting together and carrying out negotiations for each one 's benefits that was never seen in ancient china . 
they made mutual concessions , and did not use violent methods to beat down and replace opponents . 
in this way , by setting various contracts , power continuously was released into the hands of aristocrats and commoners , the rights of aristocrats and commoners became greater and greater , and the power of the king lesser and lesser . 
until finally the english queen was just a empty position , and did not have any real power . 
democracy was gradually realized in this way ! 
now look back and compare , in ancient china , where all power was concentrated in the hands of the emperor ( except for li shimin of the tang dynasty ) with almost no aristocrats , peasants could not easily enjoy a kettle of tea or cup of wine with them at the negotiating table , and mutually compromise in a relaxed and happy way to set up contracts with both sides happy . 
under this situation , when the right to life was being exploited , they could only take up violent methods to topple the current dynasty , aiming to replace them . 
the result was successive dynasties , from the high point of the tang dynasty to the abnormal situation of the ming dynasty . 
comparing chinese and western history , we learn there seems to be not one western country who in ancient times had such intensified contradictions between those in power and those ruled over as in china . 
there is not one western country that was like ancient china and had endless peasant uprisings . 
in western countries , when the ancient royal households and peasants had contradictions , the aristocrats and commoners appealing for their own benefits thought $number to reach resolutions through the method of negotiations , and made some mutual concessions to gradually gain more rights . only rarely did they take up the method of violence . 
understanding from this , now that we have entered $date , on the internet one can still see some fighters of democracy that have received the heritage of utterly absolutist totalitarianism thinking from the ming dynasty . 
also because the poison of the cultural revolution has infested their bodies , these fighters of democracy only talk about overthrowing and toppling and nothing else . 
these ideas are the biggest obstacles to democracy , because these people do not understand that negotiations and concessions are the most important method on the road to realizing democracy . 
& lt ; headline & gt ; cao xiaoming enriching village cultural activities , who will " foot the bill " 
& lt ; poster & gt ; hou ze 
this spring festival , the author was lucky to go to a mainland village for the chinese new year and visit some relatives and friends . 
while infected with the thick atmosphere of the new year of china 's villages , i was uneasy about the lake of cultural activities in the villages . 
the author discovered in the village of a close friend and relative that in past years whenever this village celebrated spring festival , they would organize the villagers and put on a local play called " horse racing lantern , " 
this play uses characters from the three kingdoms period as its theme . adults and children can all play a part in the game and the villagers never get tired of it . 
this countryside has many troupes that performed " horse racing lantern , " they would not only play in that village but also stroll to other villages ; with these troupes coming and going , everything was quite lively . 
but this year this village did not organize the play . 
it turns out that just purchasing a costume for " horse racing lantern " costs a large amount of money . in the past villagers would put together their money to buy costumes , and now these costumes are worn out to where they cannot be worn again . 
the troupes went door to door asking villagers for a little money , but none of the folks were willing to give anything , and other villages of that countryside also had similar situations . 
without " horse racing lantern , " the village became cold and quiet all of a sudden ; 
adults began to play mahjong , 
children began to play cards , 
and all the villagers said this new year was boring . 
setting off firecrackers and playing mahjong became the main scenes in the villages celebrating chinese new year . 
the tendency of gambling is incessant despite repeated prohibitions , and tends to spread rampantly . seeing losses and wins reaching $number rmb has become a common thing , especially for the large number of farmers returning from jobs in away from the countryside , they have become the main characters seen at gambling halls . 
the hard earned money from a year of work skips away so easily , 
and family disputes brought about by gambling break out frequently ; some even become tragedies with families falling apart or people dying . 
some farmers say that they not only gamble during the chinese new year , but also participate in gambling when they are not farming ; 
if you don 't gamble you have no place to go . 
if you want to do some cultured activities in the village , finding " entertainment " is too hard ; 
not only does the village not have facilities and funds , there is no one to organize them . 
in this aspect , there is no doubt that the practice of jiangxi province is a happy note for farmers . 
to enrich the cultural life of the farmer masses , jiangxi 's provincial government began to implement the " government puts out money , the market operates it , villages and towns build stages , and farmers watch plays " policy since last $date . 
every year the government arranges at least $number rmb of special funds for the villages ' cultural causes , sending excellent cultural products to the masses of the villages . 
with the beginning of the chinese new year , the government put out another $number rmb , for a total of $number rmb of special funds to establish villages ' cultural causes . 
the things that have been bought with this special funding are fairly substantial : 
the fund invites various professional cultural and arts performance groups to carry out performances in villages no less than four times every year in every countryside and town . 
it invites all levels of movie companies to organize groups to come to villages and show movies - at least six story films or documentaries every year in every administrative village . 
it organizes and opens up cultural activities for the masses that have local characteristics - at least two to three times each year for every countryside and town . 
from this " shopping list " , it 's not hard for us to see that the government is not just putting out a bit of money and that 's it , but is making painstaking efforts to figure out how to use limited funding to give cultural feasts that exceed the expected values for the vast number of farmers . 
at present , there is not one of the vast number of farmers who is not ecstatically happy about being exempt from the " state grain tax . " 
if all governments could be like jiangxi 's and " foot the bill " for cultural activities enriching the farmer masses , then this would be another joy for farmers . 
this " joy " would not only allow farmers to escape the mahjong table and become involved in cultural activities , it would also add " bricks and tiles " to the construction of socialist new villages . 
& lt ; headline & gt ; wang peirong 's child being kidnapped was false alarm 
& lt ; poster & gt ; peirongwangsohu@gmail.com 
wang peirong 's child being kidnapped was a false alarm 
at a little past $time on $date , wang peirong 's child completely related the following : 
on the morning of $date when wang peirong 's child was making up for a missed physics class in xuzhou 's number three high school , the gate guard called her out of class . 
the gate guard said to the child that three males of unclear identification had said to the gate guard that because her mother and father were on bad terms , the child , wang tianjiao , had not returned home for three days . 
" at present her mother was missing , and we are the managers of her mother 's working unit , and would like to go into the number three high school and take the child with us . " 
she said to the gate guard that what these three men said was totally untrue , and would not agree to go with them . 
with the help of the gate guard , the child was not taken away . 
wang peirong 's child gave her mother 's manager a telephone call to ask him to confirm this . that manager said he did not send people to xuzhou 's number three high school . 
the child then called her father 's manager . 
when the child called her father 's manager , 
she said that there were three people that came to the number three high school to take her away . 
that manager asked : " why didn 't you go with them ? " 
she answered : " if i went with them i 'd be dead . " 
after saying this the child hung up the phone . 
listening to wang peirong 's child relating this , one feels that the situation was serious and so wang peirong reported this to the police . 
on $date , the feedback information from the police station was that what was related by wang peirong 's child was basically true . 
the police station asked the chinese university of mining 's office of security if they sent people to the number three high school looking for wang peirong 's child . they answered they did not . 
the police stations asked subordinate units of the chinese university of mining 's office of security if they sent people to look for the child . the answer once again was no . 
relevant departments told wang peirong and her family to be careful of safety . 
after this incident , leaders of relevant departments of xuzhou were extremely concerned , 
and through the detective department of xuzhou 's ministry of public safety , they eliminated the likelihood of kidnapping the child . 
wang peirong thanked leaders of relevant departments of xuzhou city and the detective department of xuzhou 's ministry of public safety . 
this was a false alarm , and the main reason for this false alarm was likely the gate guard of the number three high school . 
the detective department of xuzhou 's ministry of public safety now has investigated it clearly : on $date , three managers of wang peirong from the college of science were urgently looking for wang peirong because they could not find her ( as of now nobody knows what had happened to wang peirong ) , they thought to look for the teachers of wang peirong 's child at the number three high school , and ask them if the child was in xuzhou or not . 
a serious subject : why is the danger of being corrupt relatively low , and the cost of being anti - corrupt instead relatively high ? 
http://bbs.people.com.cn/bbs/readfile?whichfile=44796&amp;typeid=39 
with the current cadre mechanisms and anti - greed mechanisms , what greedy officials need to worry about is managing those several related officials , and not the multitudes of the people . 
thus , as soon as he thinks he has successfully hoodwinked or flattened out those several officials that effect his fate , then he can be at ease with his boldness and enjoy a great career of corrupt accumulation of wealth as his heart desires , and ignore the hardships of the masses surrounding him . 
alternatively , if a ordinary person with no power sees injustice and comes out against corruption , he will likely bring about cruel attacks and retributions to himself , 
or have a political collar placed around his neck , and be put in a position to die at any time before he is victorious . 
comparing the two : the risk in being corrupt is relatively low , the cost of being anti - corrupt is relatively high .
